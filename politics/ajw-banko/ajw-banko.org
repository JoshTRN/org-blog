#+TITLE: Actual Justice Warrior is an Insane Racist Freak
#+INCLUDE: ~/org/blog/politics/header.org

* Introduction
In response to the controversy of Banko Brown being killed after stealing from a Walgreens, Actually Deranged Racist Freak (a.k.a Actual Justice Warrior, a.k.a Sean Fitzgerald) DE-cided to embellish the recorded events surrounding the incident. I wrote a tweet thread responding to his "recounting" of the events, which I will link, but I will also be editorializing those same themes here. All of AJW's video references will be timestamped where they're embedded, so if you want to hear him make the claims himself, just play the embedded videos.

* Actual False-Reporting Warrior

The first claim I want to address that Actual Racist Freak Warrior is where he tries to paint Brown as an attempted murderer. He says:

#+begin_quote
"Banko decided to lunge at the security guard with a knife." - AJW
#+end_quote

#+begin_export html
<div class="video-container">
<iframe class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8jDoHymRBI?start=558" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
#+end_export


Actually Racist Freak Warrior continues,

#+begin_quote
"[Banko Brown] drew a knife on the security guard, but that the security guard did not pull the trigger at the moment the knife was presented." - AJW
#+end_quote

</div>
#+end_export

Unfortunately for this racist freak, these claims aren't even supported by /[[https://sfstandard.com/criminal-justice/walgreens-san-francisco-guard-released-from-jail/][his own source]] that he shows on screen while he says it/. Contrast what the racist freak says with what, again for emphasis /his own source/, actually says:

#+begin_quote
AJW: "Banko decided to lunge at the security guard with a knife".

Source: "[[https://sfstandard.com/criminal-justice/walgreens-san-francisco-guard-released-from-jail/#:~:text=Brown%20threatened%20to%20stab%20Anthony][Brown threatened to stab Anthony]]..."
#+end_quote

It doesn't take much mental acuity to realize that one can threaten to stab someone without "lunging with a knife." In fact, one can even threaten to stab someone /without actually possessing a knife at all!/ Either AJW is illiterate, hallucinating things that aren't there, or lying.


Here's yet another example of contrasting once again what he said with his own source:

#+begin_quote
AJW: "Banko decided to lunge at the security guard with a knife".

Source: "[[https://sfstandard.com/criminal-justice/walgreens-san-francisco-guard-released-from-jail/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20source%2C%20that%20is%20when%20Brown%20approached%20Anthony%2C%20who%20fired%20his%20gun][According to the [aforementioned anonymous] source, that is when Brown approached Anthony, who fired his gun]]."
#+end_quote

Once again, "approaching" doesn't mean "lunging" and it certainly says nothing of a knife. It's painful that something so obvious needs to be stated.

* Refuting A Racist

Things gets even worse for AJW. Not only do his own sources not support his claims, several other sources directly contradict them! This establishes that on top of being delusionally illiterate or a liar, he's also too lazy to properly research.

#+begin_quote
"[District Attorney Brooke Jenkins] says there's no indication brown was armed."
[[https://youtu.be/oBCjyLECsJo?t=40][- ABC7 News Bay Area]]
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
"However, [District Attorney Brooke] Jenkins noted that the only weapon found in the incident was the gun used by Anthony."
[[https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/banko-brown-fatal-shooting-san-francisco-walgreens-security-guard-no-charges/#:~:text=However%2C%20Jenkins%20noted%20that%20the%20only%20weapon%20found%20in%20the%20incident%20was%20the%20gun%20used%20by%20Anthony][- CBS News Bay Area]]
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
"Investigators tell us that there was no weapon displayed, but that this 24 year old threatened to stab the guard."
[[https://youtu.be/RPploAgIdHA?t=155][- KTVU FOX 2 San Francisco]]
#+end_quote


I find this especially funny because he later claims that he's late to report on issues, thought I've heard him convey the sentiment multiple times, and waits due to wanting to get his facts accurate:

#+begin_quote
"I get criticized on my channel for reporting on stories late, but one of the reasons why I wait on stories is for the information to be accurate before I cover it. And when I make a mistake, I usually announce my mistake clearly and obviously in the beginning of the video or when I make an assumption or anything like that so you guys could know that I'm trying to tell the truth to you." - AJW

Note carefully when he says he "usually announces his mistakes clearly and obviously." As you can see from when the video was uploaded, no effort has been made to correct his mistakes even after pointed out to him on twitter. I, of course, won't hold my breath for a retraction.


* "Evil White Racism": A Good Explanation

"Evil White Racism" is a hyperbolic and ironic phrase Sean, the Actually Evil White Racist Warrior, uses to pithily DE-nounce claims of systemic injustices suffered by black Americans. Here I'll be /arguing/ that, at least in Sean's case, it's a good explanation for his behavior and that he is, in fact, an evil white racist.


What sense is one to make of the apparent interpolation, hallucination, illiteracy, outright lies, and laziness examined previously? If Sean did see things that weren't there, did read between the lines or even lied or refused to look it up, what's the explanation for this? Well, to no one's surprise, what would be a good explanation of any of these phenomena is that Sean is a psychotic racist freak, and as a psychotic racist freak, Sean hates black people and, because he hates black people, wants them to be viewed as threats to white people. Notice that this explains any of the plausible interpretations. Why did he read that stuff into the text? Well reading that stuff into the text makes black people look like a threat. Why did he outright lie about it? Because lying makes black people look like a threat. Why does he have selective illiteracy? Selective illiteracy makes black people look like a threat in this instance. Why didn't he look for counter-evidence? He hates black people and wants them to be viewed as a threat.

Surely, the reader might ask, isn't this consistent with him merely being a dumbass in this one instance? Aren't we coming to conclusions too hastily? Well, I think not, but let's think about what we would expect to see if I were right.

Look at the following thumbnails and video titles:

[[file:blm-frames-white-girl.png]]
[[file:blm-riots.png]]
[[file:ralph-yarl-hoax.png]]
[[file:white-girl-victim.png]]

All of these thumbnails give the same impression. It's very important to Sean to point out the race of victims of crimes when they're white and their victimizers are black. Black people are threats to white people who are largely innocent. This is exactly what's expected on the hypothesis that Sean is in fact a DE-ranged racist freak.

** Recap

If we generally see what we expect to see from a racist coming from Sean, Sean is racist.

We expect lazy reporting (if you can even call it that) from racists.
We expect racist freaks to lie to make things seem worse than they really are.
We expect insane, hallucinogenic eisegesis from DE-ranged racist freaks.
We expect selective illiteracy from psychotic racist freaks.
We expect selective reporting negatively on black people from unhinged racist freaks.
We expect demonizing thumbnails of black people from DE-mented racist freaks.

Sean is an insane racist freak.


* Closing Thoughts

Although irrelevant to the main message of this blog so far, there were other things relating to this video I want to discuss. I find bizarre that in Sean's video he claims that he didn't know Brown's gender. While taking the very minimal time to research this (Seriously, it took me maybe 20 minutes to read the articles and compile the evidence which is as long as his entire video) I wasn't even searching for the gender, and I found several sources saying Brown was a transman... including /in the description of one of Sean's own sources/!!! I'm sensing a theme here.

It reads:

#+begin_quote
"A vigil was held Friday night to remember Banko Brown, a man killed in a shooting at a Walgreens in San Francisco" [[https://youtu.be/b1Yzx1FBqac][- ABC7 News Bay Area]]
#+end_quote

I just can't believe Sean was confused about this. Jesus, he really just is a lazy racist moron.

The worst part of all this is if he weren't so insane, he could have been a little bit more covert with his racism and made essentially the same argument. In several of these sources the DA makes it clear that the video footage shows that Brown was violent, thus justifying the self-defense adjudication. That means he didn't have to be insane and interpolate or blatantly lie, whichever it was he did, in order to make his point. He could have gone the much more dog whistly approach instead of just DE-ciding to make shit up either because his DE-lusional racist brain read words that weren't there or was just so racist he had to lie.

* Bonus
I searched "little mermaid" on his channel home page.

How could I have possibly guessed that I'd find his "commentary" on it?

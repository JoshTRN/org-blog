* Good Morning, Noumena!

We've come a long way since the sleep regression in November. Even when I catch Noumena waking in the night, her groans are soft, faint, subtle and short-lived. I don't know if it all would have happened the same naturally or if the consistent routine I've kept Noumena on her whole life plays a big part in her sleep regression ending. Whatever the reason, Noumena as returned back to my wonderful sleeper from a few months ago---an even better sleeper in fact because she sleeps soundly for up to 12 hours without needing me to go in and check on her. It's been really helpful in returning to these journal entries after having difficulty the last month and a half.

My alarm sounds at 8:30am, but I don't roll out of bed until 8:45-ish. Even so, I have plenty of time for readying Noumena's breakfast before going into her room to awaken her. Not even the clatter of Chalmers' claws against the hard floor stirs her from sleep. In fact, it's after 9am when I enter Noumena's bedroom to awaken her which is unusual since I normally wake up earlier. Nevertheless, when I see her there, sleeping soundly, I can't help but film my precious beauty as she sleeps.

Feeling I bit rushed, I separate Noumena's oatmeal out into a bowl for me as well as her and sitting across from her, we enjoy our breakfast together and I'm treated to the most precious, innocent, and amazing smiles and behavior I've ever seen from another human. Despite wanting to hurry along, I can't help but gaze at her as she looks back at me nodding in joy and investigating the surroundings she's fascinated by no matter how familiar.

After our meal, I take Noumena to her room to get dressed for the day---like always, giving her the choice of what to wear. Despite wanting to put her in a new outfit I'd bought her a little while ago thinking today was a good opportunity, when presented with the choice, she chose her black sweats. Of course, since she decided that the sweats were what we were wearing, I swallowed my desire to see her in the other outfit and dressed her how she wanted to be dressed.

We ready to start our day. I take her out to the car and drive her to daycare.

* Dinner

Mommy called me just before I got off work and asked if I would take her and Noumena to dinner since she had things she needed to do so she couldn't stay with us long. Of course I'm happy to oblige, so when I pick Noumena up from daycare, we head to Mommy's place to pick her up and take her with us. Mommy decides she wants Japanese food, so we go to a place close by called Sake House.

We sit down do eat and Noumena is teeming with energy! Mommy sets out the sugar packets for her to play with and Noumena, holding the sugar packets up to Mommy's mouth, Mommy blows on them and it turns into a game.

Noumena's energy could seemingly power an entire city! She won't stop bouncing and grabbing at things on the table---playing with straws and water and everything in between. Finally, after a little prodding from Mommy, I take Noumena outside to burn off some steam. There's not much in the way of curious areas to explore nearby, but since she's so young, she finds fascination in the entire world and banal things adults wouldn't bat an eye at. So we walk behind the restaurant and proceed to run back and forth in the parking lot doing spins and crouching and just having a good time.

Eventually, Mommy calls me and tells us to come back. Right as we're getting ready to go back, Noumena appears to signify to me that she's made a mess in her diaper by grabbing her back side. Not sure if that's what she's actually doing, I scoop her up to check her diaper. I can't see anything and it hardly smells, but I get a whiff and since she's had that bout of diarrhea, I play it safe and change her---luckily having diapers and wipes in the car. Worried that I wouldn't, I'm going to keep them in a special place in the car ensuring that I always have them should such an occasion arise. They don't have a changing table in the restrooms in the restaurant, so I change her in the car and bring her back in to enjoy a nice meal after washing up.

As dinner concludes, we drive back home stopping first to drop Mommy off. On the way home, Noumena grows a little frustrated or restless in her car seat so I reach my hand back to caress her face which has a calming effect, yet every time I take a turn requiring both hands to be on the steering wheel thus pausing my caressing of Noumena, her groans begin---so I go right back to caressing her when I can until we make it to the house.

* At Home

We arrive home just at 7pm. Noumena wants down immediately after I get her out of her car seat, but doesn't want to go inside, so I pick her right back up and carry her to the door. As soon as we traverse the doorway, Chalmers is frantic! Noumena matches his energy as I set her down and she's running around with him as he runs around eventually culminating in him knocking her over so I let him outside.

Noumena lies on the floor whining from the interaction with, but you can tell she's fine from the blank stare she's wearing on her face that she's totally fine despite the cries escaping her mouth, so I get the laundry out that I had started earlier and take it to the bedroom to commence folding it and putting it away. Not long after, the cries cease and---as I knew she would---Noumena joins me in the bedroom to help. As is usual, she's not as helpful as she'd like to be insisting that she be the one to move the clothes back and forth and getting frustrated with me every time I try to actually put stuff away. Nevertheless, I'm still able to fold and put away /most/ of the laundry without issue.

I'm not sure when, but at some point Kisa joined us on the bed. She tolerates Noumena for a while, but when she leaves Noumena and I begin wrestling. Chalmers, either feeling protective or jealous of Noumena, hops on the bed and partakes in the wrestling match. At one point, I was wrestling a baby with my right arm and a dog with my left! Eventually, Noumena stopped wrestling and just laid on me to witness the spectacle of me wrestling with Chalmers.

At some point, Noumena makes her way to the table and sits down indicating that she'd like to eat. I retrieve the leftovers from the Japanese restaurant and give her tofu and rice. She finishes all the rice leaving some tofu in her dish (it definitely wasn't the best tofu we'd ever had) and makes her way into the living room where we read a few books together. With about 20 minutes left until bath time, wanting a break, I turn on the TV and Noumena, still bursting with energy dances to the music in her own little toddler way.

* Bath & Bed Time

Noumena's diaper rash has cleared up enough to the point where she feels comfortable following our standard bath time routine of drawing the bath, disrobing, putting her clothes in the laundry basket and throwing her diaper away. Bath time is easy as usual and she doesn't even whine when I clean her diaper rash signifying to me that it's much better from yesterday.

After her bath, I let Noumena choose her pajamas as usual---she chooses the Mickey Mouse Halloween pajamas---brush her teeth and take her into her dark room to listen to our bed time playlist. Naively, I hope she'll let me hold her in my arms to go to sleep like we used to. Of course, she's in love with her crib and blankets, so she demands to be laid in bed. I tuck her in as /Isn't She Lovely/ plays in the background and she falls asleep almost instantaneously. Nevertheless,  I hold her hand through our entire 14 minute playlist before leaving her to get a restful sleep.

Goodnight, Noumena! We have a three day weekend on the horizon, so lots of opportunities for fun!

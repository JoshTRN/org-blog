(2) 15-ounce cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup finely chopped celery
1/4 cup chopped green onion or red onion
2-3 tablespoons fresh dill or 1 teaspoon dried dill
1/4-1/2 cup vegan mayo or plain yogurt
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste

In a large bowl, mash the chickpeas with a potato masher (or fork) until chunky. It's okay if some beans are whole.

Add the celery, onion, dill, vegan mayo and salt. Stir well to combine.

You can enjoy it right away or cover and place in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
Assemble sandwiches: Serve in between bread with the toppings you prefer. I like sprouts, lettuce, tomato and a little mustard. Enjoy!

* Good Morning, Noumena!!!

Noumena let me sleep so much this morning. My alarm went off at 8:30am and I even snoozed it a few times and she wasn't making any noises from her room. at 8:40am, I crawled out of bed to heat up the last of Noumena's porridge to split between the two of us. When I get into her room she's awake and happy to see me. I spent some time just adoring her as she played in her crib. I got her giant stuffed bear out of the closet, set it in there with her, and then grabbed the rest of her blankets that she hasn't been sleeping with since she got the owl comforter from me and owl blanket from her mother for Christmas---letting her roll around and run into the bear. Telling her I love her a few times and asking for kisses, eventually, I ask her if she's ready to eat. She stretches her arms out of the crib reaching for Daddy to pick her up. As I carry her out of her room, she says good morning to her owl canvases as we head to the dining room.

As usual, Noumena's porridge is there waiting for her, and the second she sees it she starts reaching for it. I'm so glad she loves it so much. It's all whole foods---apples, mango, rice, and sweet potato---so I don't feel guilty feeding it to her at all. I'm gonna have to go with oatmeal tomorrow, unfortunately, though because I'm all out. Probably going to have to make more porridge for her on my lunch tomorrow.

I sit across from her Noumena to eat with her this morning. Unfortunately, I didn't giver her the opportunity to choose her spoon as only one of her spoons was clean. When we finish eating, I tell Noumena it's time to change her diaper and she follows me back into her bedroom to get ready for the day ahead. Unfortunately, I didn't give her a choice of what to wear because I just washed her clothes from yesterday and I really love this blue outfit I got her, so I got her dressed in that.

We drove all the way to Noumena's daycare only for me to discover that they weren't operational today. I don't remember them telling me anything about not working the day after Christmas, and unfortunately I can't find a calendar online or notifications in the daycare monitoring app to tell me when they open back up. I called Noumena's mother since she's so close telling her that Noumena's daycare is closed. Fortunately, she is able to watch Noumena while I work so we go to pick her up and drive back home.

It was wonderful being able to periodically leave the office to spend time with my daughter throughout the day.

* Lunch

 Despite having eaten breakfast---or perhaps because of---I was so hungry and I couldn't wait for lunch. I was really craving Thai food, so I went and picked up some green curry. Noumena, Mommy ate at Noumena's table and I ate beside them at the dining room table. Noumena eats just about everything we give her, but she is particularly keen on rice, so that was the majority of what she ate.

 When 2pm rolls around, I laid Noumena in her crib for a nap. She doesn't resist when I lay her down, but if she's not exhausted, she doesn't want to go to sleep. It pains me to do it, but I know if I leave her in there, she will fall asleep sooner rather than later, so I turn on her sound machine and let her cry for a few minutes leaving the room. She does calm down quickly and falls right asleep.

* Early Afternoon

Mommy had gotten a flat tire yesterday and she needed to get it fixed because she has stuff she has to take care of tomorrow, so I had to hang out with Noumena after she woke up from her nap at about 4pm allowing me to get off work early and giving me the opportunity spend more time with her than is usual for a weekday. We hang out for about an hour in the house reading books and playing with toys. She's particularly interested in these necklaces Mommy got her, so I monitor her playing with those before I decide we should walk to the park.

* Evening Stroll

On our way to the park, Mommy sees us walking down the street and so she takes us the rest of the way there. Not wanting to be away from Mommy, however, when we get there and Noumena watches Mommy drive off, she wants to follow her, so I decide to carry her on my shoulders back home. Just as we approach home, we see Mommy once again heading to the store to pick something up. Knowing Noumena wanted to spend time with her mother, I strap her into the car seat and get in the back to hang out with her. Noumena and I have a blast just hanging out in the car, playing with toys and talking to each other.

* Dinner

I had already prepared some rice for us to eat thinking I was also going to fry up some beans, but once Noumena saw the rice, she didn't want to wait at all, so I loaded some into her bowl and didn't even give her utensils to eat with. She shoveled it in her mouth with her hands. While she was eating, I heated up some of the left over /chana masala/ I had from out Indian dinner last night and mixed it into the rice sharing it with Noumena. Noumena's mother also made some chicken nuggets and fed that to her as well.
* Hanging out At Home

[[file:resting-hand-on-daddy.jpg]]

Of course, throughout the evening, we couldn't resist listening to /Levitation 21/ by Tigran Hamasyan and also /ABC/ by Polyphia. But I get restless staying inside and I think Noumena does too. I asked Noumena if she wanted to go for a walk and we head out the door.

* Hanging Out With Miss Theresa

Just as we're leaving, we see Miss Theresa sitting on the porch across the street, so we go to say hi. Just as we arrive, there are 2 basketballs in the yard, one---Miss Theresa informs me---she had found just the other day down the street. Noumena instantly throws the ball to Miss Theresa and Miss Theresa throws it back. They play like this for a little while involving Daddy from time to time. I try to show Miss Theresa all the new words and things Noumena's learned, but Noumena is much too distracted with play to pay super stringent attention what I asking her to do. She does get out a few "thank yous" tossing the ball back and forth with Miss Theresa, however and I show her some of the funny stuff Noumena has learned.

One of Jeremiah's riding toys catches Noumena's eye and she decides to push it out into their lawn. Eventually, she gets far enough out that I worry about her heading into the street, so I go out there, turn her around and she pushes it back onto Miss Theresa's porch. I'm glad she's getting some exercise. Noumena has so much energy she really needs to be absolutely worn down every single day or she won't sleep as well as she needs to. I spin her around a few times in their yard and we say our goodbye's to Miss Theresa. It was a lot of fun seeing her.

* Before Bed

We decide to forgo bath time so Noumena has more time to spend with Mommy. Mommy and Noumena brush each other's hair and play at home together until 8:40pm rolls around when I get Noumena ready for bed. I let her choose her pajamas but she doesn't want to with Mommy present because she just wants Mommy to hold her. Mommy chooses Noumena's owl pajamas for her, I get Noumena dressed, brush her teeth and we head out to the car to take Mommy home.

* Bed Time

When we get back, Noumena doesn't appear to be tired at all. Nevertheless, it's 9:05pm---passed Noumena's bed time---so I take her to her crib straight away which I had gotten ready for our return. Still unable to let go, I start playing our bed time playlist hoping Noumena will want to fall asleep as I hold her in my arms, but unfortunately she wants to lay in her bed straight away. I caress her face as /Isn't She Lovely/ plays in the background amidst the rain sounds emanating from her sound machine. At the end of /Isn't She Lovely/ Noumena, although closing her eyes, is still awake. I lay beside her crib, reaching my hand through the bars to hold hers and I lay next to her as she falls asleep, hand in my own, while /Stand By Me/ plays. Using her stuffed bear as a pillow, I continue to hold Noumena's hand until /Just The Two Of Us/ is over even falling asleep myself alongside her. I leave her, bundled up in her bed, to drift peacefully into dream land.

I loved getting to spend extra time with you today Noumena. I'm so grateful to have these opportunities with you. Goodnight, my wonderful, lovely, precious, beautiful baby girl! See you bright and early for school tomorrow!!!

* Good Morning, Noumena

Again, I'm awoken by my alarm sounding at 8:30am. Noumena has allowed me to awaken naturally once again. The entire time I prepare her oatmeal, she remains quiet in her room which is good because it gives me plenty of time to make sure her oatmeal is cool enough to eat. As is customary, I lay out her breakfast with a cup of soymilk and choice of spoon before entering her room to get her ready to start her day. When I enter her room, she wasn't sleeping, but still seemingly resting on her blankets. She loves her blankets so much that when she doesn't even want to get out of her crib when I enter---instead opting to pick up any one of her three blankets in there at a time and move them around and then start rolling around in them. Eventually, after asking her several times if she wants to eat, she decides it's a good idea and lets me pull her from her crib.

I don't have anything to eat myself, so I take the time when she's eating to make myself some coffee and clean up a little around the house. Curiously, the entire time she eats, she doesn't touch her soymilk. Normally, she's thirsty in the mornings, but I guess today is different. As she eats her meal, periodically, she stands to go say hi to Chalmers or play in the living room. When she's finally done, I ask her to follow me to her room to change her diaper and get ready. She obliges---chasing me down the hall---and I give her a selection between two outfits for the day. She chooses her red, plaid long-sleeve shirt with her black pants and I get her dressed for the day before heading out.

On our way to the daycare, glancing back at her, I notice she's reading her book and making the cutest noises and I'm compelled to capture them on video.

* Daycare Pickup

Entering Noumena's daycare, she's enjoying an evening snack of graham crackers. Sadly, she's so focused on what she's doing, she's not even excited to see me. She remains seated and continues to eat, but after  a few brief moments, she decides she wants to show me around. Standing up, she attempts to grab my hand and lead me around. She leads me to a toy rotary phone (I wonder when those are going to disappear), picks it up, holds it to her ear and then hands it to me to do the same. I'm ready to go, so I pick her up---graham cracker still in hand---and take her out to the car so she can finish eating it on the way back home.

* Playing At Home

Arriving home, Noumena sees Kisa across the street and tries to chase after her. Of course, I don't let noumena go into the street, but Kisa wants to come to us anyway. Kisa heads walks to the driveway and starts heading towards the house. Determined to pet her, Noumena follows closely behind. She gets a few good pets in, but Kisa is much more nimble and evades Noumena all the way up to our porch. When I open the door, Noumena is excited to greet Chalmers. She's so independent. I remember back when she would cry if Daddy let her go when we got home. All she used to want to do was be in Daddy's arms. My little girl is growing up too fast.

Since she's already had a snack, I know there's some leeway time before I have to prepare dinner. Today I noticed that footrest for the couch had been pulled away from the couch a little and so I thought it would be fun to convert it into a little fort for her.

After playing in the fort, we read a few books together. Now that she has a book shelf, whenever we finish one book, I get her to take it back to the bookshelf and put it back before grabbing another one out to read. We read 3 books tonight: /Pat The Zoo/, /Never Touch A Dragon/, and /Go Dog, Go/. At some point, she noticed her claw machine she'd gotten for Christmas resting atop the refrigerator, so I get it down and begin to show her how to use it. I think it's a little advanced for her. She's more interested in watching me operate the claw to get the toys out than she is attempting to do it herself. However, once a fair amount of toys are dropped out, I open the top and allow her to put them back in. That's her favorite part! She loves pulling stuff out of containers and putting it back in!

* Walking To CVS

I let Chalmers out to go to the bathroom and Kisa came in expecting food, so once I let Chalmers back in I prompt Noumena to feed the pets. Chalmers still has plenty of food, so we only get halfway since Kisa's out of food. Not wanting to make a big trip to the store just for cat food, I decide to take Noumena with me to the CVS nearby to get a small pack of cat food to hold Kisa over until we do a proper grocery haul. I get Noumena's shoes on and we head out the door stopping by the car to get her jacket out and put it on.

Noumena walks with me to the end of the block, but surprisingly wants to be carried after that. Repeatedly, I ask her if she wants to get down and walk and every time she says "no" in the cutest voice imaginable and shakes her head. Happy to hold her in my arms, I carry her the all the way down the second block only setting her down once we're in the church parking lot where we run and jump and climb together.

When it's finally time to continue on our path to CVS, we have to cross a small water duct that Noumena wants to go into. I can't let her go down into it for obvious reasons, but she wants to, so she starts her spaghetti legs so I'm forced to pick her up. She gets very upset by this and begins to hit me. I'm not sure where she learned to hit, and my approach to dealing with it has always been to stop her, tell her I like gentle touches, and move her hand softly to caress me instead of hitting. This time is a little different, though. She fights back pretty vigorously and when I take her hand to touch me gently, she just pinches my face instead! I'm forced to just keep her arms from hitting me. Thankfully it's short-lived as we approach the store.

Walking into the store, we see a worker there we've known for a long time named Mosely who comes up to greet us. When I set Noumena down to follow me through the store,  she's transfixed with automatic sliding doors and stares for a few seconds before I get her to follow me back to the cat food. As we walk, she tries to grab the various items off the shelves, but I tell her not to touch and she's very obedient instead allowing me to guide her by the hand to the pet isle. I let her choose the cat food we get for Kisa, let her use my card to pay at the cash register and carry her on my shoulders all the way back home while pretending to let her carry the bag containing the cat food.

* More Playing At Home

Right as we get home, I get Noumena to finish what we started and feed Kisa. She begins to play in her fort a little bit, so I think I'm going to have a good amount of time to cook dinner. Unfortunately I was wrong, so I use the electronic baby sitter to distract her while I cook. Thankfully, she's content to watch music videos on autoplay, which, out of all the television options, I have the least issue with.

* Dinner

Tonight for a late dinner at around 7:30pm, I made Rice and Beans. Setting them out in separate bowls, I thought for certain Noumena would be more interested in the rice than the beans from my past experiences, but she surprised me again and was way more interested in the beans. She ate all of them and asked for more, and sitting down to eat across from her, she came over to grab the food off my plate before I could refill hers!

After dinner, we continued playing and she helped me fold the laundry and put on the bed sheets until bath time.

* Bath & Bed Time

At some point during the evening, I found Noumena going into the bathroom playing with the cats food. She knows she's not supposed to, so when I came in after her and said, "Noumena, you know you're not supposed to be doing that," in the cutest fit possible she comes running out of the bathroom at top speed whining and trying to hit me with both hands. I'm not sure what it is about the cat's dish, but she loves taking the food in and out of it. When it's bath time, she bolts in there and uses it as an excuse to grab the cat's food out of the dish and throw it into the bath tub! I got the broom to sweep it up and while in the middle of sweeping, she reaches into the bowl, grabs another handful of food and throws it into the tub! So, I closed the bathroom door allowing me to clean up uninterrupted before finally allowing her back in to draw the bath.

We follow our usual routine of bathing, picking out pajamas, getting dressed and brushing our teeth. Naively, or perhaps a better way to put it is optimistically, I think that she'll let me hold her in my arms to fall asleep tonight. Again, I'm disappointed and lay her down in her crib. While she lays in her crib, I lay beside her reaching my hand through the bars of the crib and hold her hand for the entire duration of our bedtime playlist. At least she still wants me to hold her hand to go to bed. I'm not excited for that to end.

Goodnight, Noumena! I'm excited to see what we're going to get up to tomorrow.

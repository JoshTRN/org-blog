* Good Morning, Noumena!

My alarm went off at 8:30am and not a peep from Noumena's room. I endeavored to get up, but decided that since it's the weekend, I'll let myself sleep in. I slept until about 9am and finally pulled myself from bed. As I readied Noumena's breakfast, I could hear her gradually begin to waken. I let Chalmers out and went to retrieve Noumena.

Sometimes it's so hard to place the emotions conveyed by her facial expressions. As I entered her room, she was playing with her blankets.  When I approached her crib, she made this face that she often makes which is so hard to describe. She squints her eyes, semi-puckers her lips and opens her mouth slightly. I honestly can't even tell if it's a positive expression or a negative expression. Either way it's extremely cute. She points to her owl banner and rolls around in her blankets---she has four of them in her crib now---and eventually I persuade her to join me for breakfast. As I pick her up, I notice she has a smelly diaper, so I change it, wash her hands and take her to the freezer to remove her oatmeal, give her a choice of spoon to eat with and sit her down. I separated the oatmeal out into 2 bowls, one for me and one for her, and sit across from her to eat.

Noumena eats all of her oatmeal and surprisingly asks for more, so I open another packet and ready it in the microwave while she plays in the living room. Once it cools a bit, I sit her back down to continue eating. She gets about halfway through the second serving before getting up to go play. I clean up after her and get a call from a friend who I talk to for a bit as I play with Noumena. He sits on the phone with me as I read her books. Once our conversation concludes, I get Noumena ready for the 11am story time and we leave.

* Story Time

We arrive at the library at 10:56am which is just before story time starts. I carry Noumena to the library, but of course, once we get in there, I get her to walk up the stairs as she loves it so much. We pass through the courtyard and get there just as story time begins. Noumena is content for all of 2 minutes before she gets up to start wandering around. Of course, I let her wander wherever she wants to go. Sometimes, part of me gets concerned with her attention span at story time, but I know how voracious a reader Noumena is, so I'm always comforted by that fact. The library is just too stimulating a place for her to sit still at.

Noumena makes her way all over the library and eventually wants to go outside where she wants to sit on every chair out there.

Eventually, Noumena wants to go back in the library where she wanders up to the bench shaped like a manatee and pulls out some of the books handing them to me to read to her. She's quite dissatisfied with many of the books that she picks but one book in particular catches her eye. The book is about a snowflake who is scared of everything. He's scared of a lady bug and his shadow... everything. The funny thing is that I think Noumena knows what it means to be scared, because every time I open it she cries out and hugs me wanting me to protect her. Now, I'm thinking, "okay, if you're scared put the book back and pick a different one." The thing is, I think she likes being scared. She doesn't want to put the book back. And, every time she recovers from her fear, she demands I read it again. Who am I to refuse? After all, her getting scared and then hugging me demanding affection and protection is so wholesome and lovely I'm happy to do it. Usually, her mom checks out all the books for her, but this one seems so special that I absolutely have to check it out.

I have never liked being scared and always found it strange that people do, so I start to worry internally, "Is my kid gonna want to watch horror movies all the time when she grows older?" Even though I rather dislike horror movies, I would of course want to watch them with Noumena if she was into them. Hopefully it doesn't pan out that way. Who knows? Maybe I'll garner a new found appreciation for something I never liked because of Noumena.

Before we leave, I let Noumena wander up and down the stairs all over the library since she loves it so much. As she climbs, she's captivated by the wall art. We make our way up and down a few times until finally exiting the library.

* James Weldon Johnson Park

Often when we leave the library we go to the park that's right across the street. Today is no exception, so I first take the book we checked out back to the car because I don't want to be carrying it around for the indeterminate time we're going to be spending at the pack and we return where Noumena wanders around and dances to the music they always play out of the speakers there.

It's about 12:30pm when I start thinking about lunch. I have just been having massive cravings for tofu lately, so I start looking for restaurants nearby that serve tofu. Dissatisfied with all of the options, I quickly settle on a Thai food place that's close to our house before strapping Noumena into her car seat and handing her her drawing pad to play with and we listen to her favorite songs on the way there.

* Arlingwood Park

I decided upon leaving lunch that even though it's later than usual that she'll be napping, I still want to take her out to the park while it's still warm and sunny out, so I decide to take her to Arlingwood park. I'm not sure if it's her favorite park, but I think so far it's definitely one of my favorites. Luckily for us, there's a lot of kids there. Noumena's always hesitant when she meets strangers, which is good, but once she acclimates to all the kids having such a good time she joins them in running around on the playground. My little risk taker is always trying to climb the most dangerous piece of the playground equipment. Of course, I help her the entire time.

We don't stay too long, however, since it's passed Noumena's nap time. She doesn't give me too much fuss as we leave. I think giving her a lot of opportunities to have fun and participating in the fun and interacting with her so much makes her easier to handle. When we get home, I take off her shoes, change her diaper and lay her down for nap. Noumena is really good about nap time and she impresses me. Even if she's not tired straight away, she'll lay in her crib contentedly until she falls asleep... as long as Daddy is by her side, that is.

* Trip to CVS

Noumena awakes after only an hour of sleep. I'm conflicted about it because while I'd like her to have napped longer thus giving me more of a break, I know that the earlier she awakens, the easier it will be to put her down for bed at night. When I go in, she's in a great mood, but I soon discover that the reason she'd woken up was that she had a poopy diaper. I change her and we spend some time playing with Chalmers in her room before I get her ready to leave.

She had been playing with the doll that her Aunt Lisa gifted her for Christmas, and I remembered that I didn't have the AAA batteries needed to operate the lights in it, and I'm also reminded that I need to change the batteries in the smoke detector, so I decide that we're going to walk to CVS to go get them. I dress her warmly and we head out.

On our way, Noumena finds a goose feather. For some reason, it bears more significance to me than it does to her. She picks it up, inspects for a few seconds and sets it down again.

Despite her immense curiosity, Noumena is so well behaved as we wander through the isles of the store looking for what we need. Right as we enter, she sees a stuffed bear on the clearance shelf, so she goes up and grabs it. I let her carry it around the store with us. Once we've acquired the batteries, I decide I'd like to buy her a snack to hold her over until dinner. I take her over to the isle that has the cliff bars and show her all the options she has to choose from. She chooses the peanut butter one for herself, and I pick a white chocolate and macadamia nut one for myself and we head to the register to check out. Of course, I try to teach her what the bar codes are and I allow her to scan each item and then tap my card to pay.

We enjoy our snacks on the way back home and spend a considerable amount of time in the church parking lot---allowing her to burn off the seemingly infinite toddler energy.

* Evening

Of course, when we get back home, the first thing I do is change the smoke detector battery and add a battery to her stuffed animal Aunt Lisa gave her. It's already dark, so I shut off all the lights in the bedroom and we turn on the stars, point them at the ceiling and gaze at them together. A periodic "wow" leaves Noumena's mouth.

* Dinner

Tofu scramble is our dinner this evening. Just as I start to get ready to cook, Noumena tells me she wants to watch TV. It's convenient timing. I let her watch music videos as I cook and once we get through about 5 of them it's dinner time.

Of course, tofu scramble is made with turmeric giving it that yellow color and she gets a little on her white blouse. I can tell though that she's much better at making less of a mess at meal times. I noticed this at lunch too, so there's not much of it on her top. I do a load of laundry right away to avoid staining her blouse and change her into her sweater.

* Night

We spend the evening reading books and playing with her toys. Regrettably, I forgot to bring her scary book in from the car, so I didn't get to read that to her tonight, but that's okay---I'll read it to her tomorrow. When I go to clean the dishes from dinner, Noumena runs up to the sink demanding my attention, so I stop what I'm doing to see if I can get her to play by herself for a little while. It's been a little while since she's played with her Montessori toys, so I get them out and it's enough to distract her long enough for me to finish the dishes.

Running out of ideas of what to play with, I take her into her room to see if that sparks any inspiration. It does and we end up playing with her blankets until it's time for bath.

* Bath & Bed Time

We follow our typical bath time routine, but I get Noumena washed somewhat hastily today. When I go to remove her from the tub, she picks up her bottles of baby shampoo and I'm lucky enough to snap the cutest picture.

[[file:holding-bottles-with-towel.jpg]]

I'm lucky that I went through the bath so quickly tonight because it took about 20 minutes for her to fall asleep. I laid her down at about 8:50pm and I wasn't confident she was asleep until about 9:10pm. We got through her whole playlist with her just laying in bed listening to it holding my hand. I even replayed /Stand By Me/ of us because after /Just The Two Of Us/ had finished, I peered up from beside her crib to find her eyes still open. Thankfully after /Stand By Me/ finished, she was fast asleep.

Noumena, I had a blast with you today! We did so much and I'm so looking forward to having a blast with you tomorrow as well.

Good night, sweet baby. I miss you already. I'll see you in the morning. Hopefully we can do something special together tomorrow!

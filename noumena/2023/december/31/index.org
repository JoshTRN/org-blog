* Good Morning, Noumena!

 I ran out of instant oatmeal to feed Noumena (for better or worse, but I lean towards better), so last before I went to bed, I made sure to make the overnight oatmeal with protein and blueberries, so when I roll out of bed at 9am as Noumena is awakening and waking me up with her, her breakfast is immediately ready for her. Feeling that she's grown accustomed to a warm breakfast, however poorly evidenced, I do decide to warm it in the microwave for a few seconds before feeding it to her. I give her a choice of spoon between pink and blue as always and to my surprise, she also decides she wants to eat at the other end of the table. Obviously, I let her.

 As we're eating, she gets a bite of blueberries, however and immediately spits it out. I thought for sure she was my kid, but now I'm starting to second guess it. How could any child of mine dislike blueberries!?! No matter, that just means more for Daddy, so I reach over to her bowl, pick out all the blueberries and allow her to continue eating.

 Once we finish eating, after cleaning up a bit, I remember the book we'd gotten from the library and as I vowed yesterday, I head outside to get it from the car to read it to her. Noumena and I read it a couple times on my lap, but eventually, she takes the book herself and starts reading it by herself scaring herself in the process and I'm lucky enough to get re reaction on camera.

Noumena's mother had come over in the morning, so after cleaning up from breakfast and playing in the living room a bit, I get her to go wake her Mommy from the nap she was taking. Her Mom makes a cup of coffee reminding me that I'd run out of creamer and so I go to the store to get some more while her Mommy watches her.

Mommy reads Noumena a few books but then Noumena decides she wants to watch TV, so we turn it on and start watching some music videos. Since Noumena likes /ABC/ by polyphia so much, her mom decides to investigate in Noumena likes to watch "girly" music videos and starts watching Brittany Spears music videos with her. I quickly grow tired of all that, so I take my leave and relax in the bedroom a short while they watch together. Eventually, I get tired of hearing it from the other room and come out and start listening to Meshuggah with Noumena... That's what I'm talking about. We watch the music videos for /Rational Gaze/ and /New Millennium Cyanide Christ/  and shortly after Mommy decides she wants to go for a walk to get exercise. I invite me and Noumena to walk with her, but she declines. I wanted to get out of the house anyway, so I put a jacket and shoes on Noumena and we head to the park.

* Tidewater Acres Park

We leave and on our way Noumena stops to be fascinated by a drain for maybe 2 minutes. We're not taking our usual route, and we see a little boy named Zavian, 5 (maybe spelled with an X? I don't know) and a little girl Caroline, 8, playing basketball. For a short while, Noumena simply observes, but eventually runs up and snatches the ball out of Zavian's hands. Zavian, being the good sport that he is, allows Noumena to take it from him and she immediately tosses it to me. I toss it back to Zavian and we toss it around for a little while before Zavian tells me I can hold Noumena up to dunk it. I do just that. We play for a little while as Caroline tells me her whole history with Zavian's family as I'm half paying attention to her and Noumena at the same time. After playing for a little while, I take Noumena to head to the park.

Noumena's starting to get excited to go to parks rather than just enjoying it while she's there. The moment I set her down near it, she runs through the gates. I ask her what she wants to play on first and she enthusiastically chooses the swings.

Once she tires of one swing she moves onto the next. We move from swing to swing and eventually get to the big kids swing which I also push her on for a short while reminding her of the last time when she let go of the chains and fell. I think she remembers because she gorilla grips the chains making sure not to let go the entire time she swings. Eventually, she wants to move on from that to another swing and then because interested in swinging the swing without her on it.

Shortly after, a man shows up to the park with his dog and Noumena is immediately curious. He's sitting a the bench, so Noumena takes me by the hand and guides me close to where he's sitting. Noumena, content to just observe the dog from about ten feet away, stands there just staring at it until it's time for them to go. When they leave, she attempts to follow them to their car. But she has to open the gate on her way after them. The gate becomes a toy. She opens and shuts it, exits and enters the park over and over again until it's passed 1pm and I want to go home to feed her.

* Lunch

Just as we get home, I tell Noumena to go rush to Mommy and I warm the leftover tofu scramble from last nights dinner. She eats rather quickly and when she's done, while I clean up after her, she goes into the bedroom and lays on the bed with Mommy. After I finished cleaning, I join them on the bed and stay with Noumena gushing to Mommy over what a great sleeper Noumena is. Once 2pm rolls around, I get to demonstrate this wonderful sleeping ability as I take Noumena into her bedroom for nap time. I turn on her white noise machine and lay beside her crib holding her hand for maybe 10 minutes until she falls asleep.

* Dinner

While Noumena slept, since her mom was there, I took this opportunity to go to the grocery store and pick up some ingredients for Dinner tonight that will also last us for the nights to come. I make vegetable soup and Noumena awakens just as it finishes simmering. Mommy asks if she's going to eat, but Noumena usually doesn't like eating right after a nap. Mommy is hungry though, so she makes herself a bowl as Noumena and I play in the living room. Noumena, seeing Mommy eat, starts to get hungry and Mommy hands her some of her buttered bread which Noumena eats and I fill a bowl of soup for her to eat and put it in the freezer to cool for a bit so it's not too hot.

Once again, I give Noumena the choice of spoon and she picks the blue one this evening. Along with the soup, I give her a cup of soymilk and a slice of buttered bread and we enjoy a lovely dinner together. During her meal, Noumena had gotten plenty of soup all over her clothing because she hasn't had enough opportunities to get used to eating soup. I used to just pick out the veggies and let her eat by hand, but since she's a big girl now, she spoons it up. It's still a little hot, so periodically, she'll hold her spoon up signifying to me to blow on it to cool it down a bit so she can eat. Of course, I'm happy to do so.

Since she had made quite the mess, I have to change her clothes. Mommy is about to leave to head out to her 7pm meeting. I had already taken her shirt off so as Mommy's leaving, a shirtless Noumena follows her to the door demanding a kiss before she leaves. Mommy kisses her good bye and I finish cleaning up before taking Noumena to put on a new sweat suit.

* Nighttime Walk

It's not long thereafter I want to get out of the house, so I get Noumena bundled up and we head outside. I walk Noumena down the driveway, but for some reason tonight she wants to be held. I carry her all the way to the church where she finally wants to be let down. I called Oksana to wish her a happy new year while we there and we talk on the phone for a bit until I want to start capturing videos of Noumena. We spend maybe an hour at the church playing on the bench that sits right outside the entryway, but mostly running around in the grass.

Noumena doesn't want to leave since she's having so much fun, but once I scoop her up, it's pretty easy to get her distracted by just pointing at objects and naming them. She gets interested in the activity and repeats after me for almost every word I say making the walk home very manageable.

* Before Bed

We get home right at 8pm. I'm tired, so I sit down and Noumena plays with her flash cards a bit before wanting to watch TV. I love letting her watch music videos so I turn on her favorite, /Levitation 21/ by Tigran Hamasyan and we watch it together. We end up watching music videos for about 20 minutes until it's time to geed the pets and take a bath.

* Bath & Bed Time

We follow our usual bath time routine, except she had a toy baby on the bed from earlier when she'd been playing with it. Not wanting to put her doll down, she throws a mild fit. It's very manageable. I put her clothes in the laundry basket for her and am able to get her up and once I take off her diaper, she's realized that her new task is to throw it away. She throws it on the ground briefly and squats over it briefly (I still haven't figured out why this is interesting) before finally getting up and throwing it away. I'm excited to give her a warm bath since it's been so cold outside.

After our bath, she picks the owl pajamas to sleep in. I dress her and brush her teeth and we go to the room where we listen to our playlist getting through the whole thing and listening to /Stand By Me/ an additional time for good measure while I lay beside her crib holding her hand through the bars until I'm certain she's asleep. She's sleeping really hard tonight. I turned up her white noise machine to the loudest setting worried that the fireworks would disturb her slumber, but even now as it's 2:40am and I write this, she hasn't made a peep. This is what they mean when they use the idiom to "sleep like a baby."

Goodnight, Noumena! I'm glad that you weren't disturbed by the fireworks at all. I hope you rest well and am looking forward to another day we have together tomorrow!!!

* Good Morning, Noumena

Not that Noumena's doing this intentionally, but I'm so appreciative of the fact that she lets me get a lot of sleep. Count your blessings, I guess. I was awoken by my alarm once again rather than Noumena making any noises in her room. I was even sluggish getting out of bed snoozing for 10 minutes before going to prepare Noumena's breakfast. I warmed her oatmeal in the microwave, let the pets out and even let it cool in the freezer to an edible temperature before ever entering Noumena's room. Because there was total silence coming from her, I filmed my entry to see if she was really asleep. What a sight to behold that was.

I give Noumena plenty of time to eat before getting her dressed and ready to go. I allow her to select her outfit for the day, get her dressed and take her to daycare.

* Daycare Pickup

Mommy arrived just before I went to pick Noumena up, but she ended up falling asleep leaving me to go pick up Noumena from daycare alone. When I get there, Noumena's just finishing up a diaper change. Apparently, she had a little diarrhea, so they dressed her in apparently the only bottoms they had which were shorts. I'm concerned about her being cold, but I know we'll be spending most of the time in the car, so that abates my worry a little bit. We wash our hands at the sink, put on her jacket and head out to the car. Once she's seated in her car seat, I hand her her etch-a-sketch and demonstrate how to clear it a few times after writing on it so that she gets the idea that after she's finished drawing, she can do the same and draw something new. I was on the phone with a friend who's drawing, so I make a joke about how Noumena is better than he is at drawing before taking off back home.

* Making Dinner With Mommy

When we arrive home, I tell Noumena that Mommy's in the bedroom, so she runs to greet her. Mommy had bought some ingredients to make a side dish to accompany Noumena's dinner, so immediately, they start making it together giving me an opportunity to film a really cute scene.

Noumena's mom also heats up some of the leftover rice and beans for Noumena to eat with the bread and dip they made together, and while Noumena eats, it gives me an opportunity to put her clothes away. I never get that opportunity when it's just me and Noumena because the second Noumena catches me putting away her clothes, she comes in to "help" which just ends in all her clothes being strewn across the floor.

* Hanging Out At Home

[[file:goofy-pose.jpg]]

Mommy reads Noumena a few books and plays with Noumena for a while. Noumena, finding her electronic flash card reader, brings it to Mommy to play with. Her flash cards are stored in a little red owl backpack her mother had gotten her for Christmas, so when she brings her mother the card reader, Mommy tells Noumena to get the backpack and bring it to her. Noumena hesitates and looks in the direction for a moment to evaluate the command she's just been given. Mommy tells me to show her where it is, but I tell Mommy to just let Noumena figure it out. Moments after I tell her mom to let Noumena figure out, she rushes over to the backpack to retrieve it for Mommy. They open the backpack and Noumena begins to remove the cards and assist Mommy in putting them into the reader.

After a little while of playing, Mommy's about to leave, so I tell Mommy to get Noumena dressed in warm clothing so we can go on a walk. She puts Noumena in the cutest sweatpants that has a matching jacket. She didn't dress Noumena in the jacket right away and I snap a couple pics with Noumena in the same top she'd gone to school with and those bottoms because it's just over the top cute especially with those little necklaces Mommy got for Noumena that she likes to put on. As Mommy's leaving, Noumena runs up to her to say goodbye, give her a kiss and tells her that she loves her.

* Nighttime Walk

Just before we leave, I get Noumena dressed in her Jacket and we head out. I'll never stop being fascinated by Noumena's burgeoning mind. When we're walking, she invents a game out of squatting and then taking off from a squatted position, running for a few moments, turning around and then squatting again to repeat the process.

[[file:at-the-stairs-at-church.jpg]]

I'm not sure why the church parking lot seems like such a good place to go, but I often find myself there with Noumena. I guess it's a wide open, desolate space that she can run around in to her heart's content. We spend most of our time just hanging around the church, climbing stairs and getting into things. She must have climbed those steep stairs 10 times which is good because hopefully that means she'll be worn out by the end of it.

We make our way back to the parking lot from where Noumena was playing at the stairs and she finds a bench outside the doors the pattern on which she's fascinated by. I sit down and pull her on the bench and we chill there for a few minutes before heading back home. She's not excited about going home and voices her discontent, but luckily for me she's easy to calm and we make our way back home only stopping briefly to look at the moon. Her fascination with celestial bodies makes me think there's something in our DNA that predisposes us to be enthralled by them. I'm so excited as she grows to teach her about astronomy and the heavens, and some day take her to someplace deep in the wilderness away from all the light pollution so she can get a true glimpse into the beauty that sits overhead at all times.

* Home Before Bath Time

We arrive home just at 8pm---30 minutes before bath time---giving us just enough time to play around in the living room before getting ready for bed.

* Bath Time

Five minutes before bath time, I get Noumena to feed the pets before drawing her bath. Following our usual routine of getting undressed and putting away her dirty clothes and throwing away her diaper, something is off. I can't tell immediately what it is, but she doesn't want to participate in the routine as usual insisting that I pick her up off the bed after undressing rather than sliding off and taking her clothes with her. Just then, I get a whiff that her diaper is dirty. Usually, it's much stronger and I can tell right after she soils it that it's dirty, but tonight I didn't detect it until it was already bath time. I carry her to the hamper to put away her clothes and take her to her bedroom to clean her with a wipe before putting her in the tub.

When I remove her diaper, I notice that she's all red! Little did I know that what she was so upset and clingy about was that she had a diaper rash! The diarrhea she'd experienced earlier was there just long enough to cause skin irritation, but wasn't bad enough for me to detect from the smell. I feel horrible having to wipe there because it clearly hurts her. Once I get her clean enough to take to the bath (don't want her bathing in poo water), she cries the whole time. Her cries are usually tear shedding cries like they are now. She's really hurting.

To calm her once she's in the water, I hold her close to me with her feet submerged kissing her all over her back and abdomen so she knows I'm not trying to put her in any position where she's likely to hurt more. I have the utmost patience when holding her. I think she knows that I'm not trying to rush her in any way and trusts me. I decide to forego the whole frustration of shampooing her hair opting instead to only scrub her body down once I get her calm. Usually, I wash her private parts first, but I don't want to have to put her through any of that if she's hurting from me cleaning her nether regions, so I scrub the parts of her body she likes most starting with her feet and moving to her arms, back and chest before finally having her stand up to wash her private parts. To my surprise, she was quite strong when I cleaned her down there only crying for a brief few moments. I really think the innumerable kisses softened the discontent.

* Bed Time

Getting her dressed is another battle, understandably so, but I apply the diaper rash cream and she's still surprisingly accommodating given her discomfort. When dressing her in pajamas, she wants me to hold her the whole time. Of course, in between putting legs and arms through sleeves, I give her all the love in the world. Once we start brushing her teeth, she's completely calmed down.

I bring her into the dark room and start our playlist hoping that since she's been through such an ordeal she'll want to fall asleep in my arms tonight, but with no such luck. The second her playlist starts playing, she wants to be in her cozy crib. I lay her down, lay beside the crib and hold her hand through the bars as she drifts off. I think the combination of all the play at the church along with the whole diaper rash ordeal has really  tuckered her out because she falls asleep almost instantaneously. Nevertheless, I get through our entire playlist laying beside her crib holding her hand before leaving her room.

Noumena, I'm sorry you went through such a difficult time tonight. If I ever become aware that you have diarrhea again, I'll take extra special care to make sure you are better taken care of.

I love you more than the moon and the stars that you adore so much, baby. I hope you have the most wonderful sleep tonight. Goodnight, baby girl. I miss you already!

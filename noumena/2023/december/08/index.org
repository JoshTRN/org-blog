It's been so long since I've written a proper journal entry. I think I was sick all of November save the final week. Unfortunately, it looks like I'm getting sick again. Two days ago, Noumena's nose started running again. It almost always spells trouble when that starts happening. Since then, she's developed a cough as well. Nevertheless, she doesn't seem to be any worse for wear. She's just as active as ever if not even more active and she hasn't developed a fever or any other symptoms, so hopefully she'll be okay.

I, on the other hand, started developing a scratchy, mildly sore throat this afternoon. That's always how it starts with me. Hopefully, like Noumena, the symptoms are very short lived.

* Morning

Noumena's been waking pretty consistently at around 8am every morning for the past week or so. She used to sleep more, but I've been getting a lot more sleep lately, so her waking a bit earlier is fine for me. For the past two weeks, we've been having a lot of instant oatmeal for breakfast. It's been a lot harder to plan and meal prep on the weekends especially with having been sick so much, so I've really heavily relied on instant oatmeal to get us going. Before I greet her in the morning, I prepare 2 packets of instant oatmeal, and stick it in the freezer to cool off. I wait a few minutes and then go into Noumena's room to say good morning.

This morning, like most mornings, Noumena's not really interested in actually getting out of the crib. The crib has become one of her favorite places to be. When she wakes up, I think the whimpers she makes indicate loneliness, because once I enter, she's totally content. I grab her giant bear and stick it in the crib with her to wrestle before it's time to eat. In fact, saying the word "eat" and using the sign for it is how I motivate her to reach her arms and demand to be removed from the crib.

We sit down to eat and while eating, Noumena's mom comes over. Noumena's mother gets Noumena dressed in her black sweats and we head out to take Noumena to daycare.

* Dinner

I didn't eat much of the dinner I'd purchased yesterday when we'd gone out to eat, so I had leftover tofu and fried rice. That's good because I hadn't gone shopping so I wasn't sure what we were going to eat. I set Noumena down to play with her flash cards while heating up our food. When the food is warm and placed on the table, she's so enthralled with her cards she doesn't even want to eat. I told her several times that dinner was ready and gestured to eat as well as saying it, but she wouldn't budge. We sat there maybe 10 more minutes as I made the noises of the animal on the card she was currently holding.

Increasingly Noumena appears less and less baby-like by the day and more and more child-like with each passing day. She's growing into a stereotype of a child and it's fascinating to witness. Her behavior at dinner is exemplary of this. Of course, as she bobs and weaves her head, I can't help but mimic her in return. Play has become less of an activity and more of a lifestyle, it seems. Even when picking Noumena up from daycare, she runs and plays and shows off before she's ready to go!

* Playing In The Crib

Without fail, the crib has become an indispensable tool for entertaining Noumena. In many respects, it's actually quite a relief for me as well. Noumena's so content in the crib, that I can take that time to take care of various tasks around the house. If I put Chalmers in the crib, along with the bear, it's enough to keep her entertained seemingly indefinitely.

At some point, I notice Noumena trying to climb out, so I decide to assist her. After that, all she wants to do is climb in and out of the crib.

* Night

After hanging out in the crib, I follow Noumena on her excursion to the living room to continue playing with her flash cards. While putting them back into the box they came out of, I can hear Kisa meowing at the front door to be let in. So, Noumena and I let Kisa in and then I ask Noumena to feed the pets. After feeding Chalmers and Kisa and putting away the scoop, Noumena wants to go back into the bathroom, presumably to throw all the food in Kisa's dish onto the ground as she's wont to do lately.

I'm not interested in her making a mess in the bathroom, so I wrangle her onto the couch. She gets off and jets for the bathroom. Once again, I lift her off her feet and hurl her back onto the couch. It's become a game. We both became reckless and one of the times she didn't get off the couch the right way and fell straight onto her head! The sound was so loud. Immediately I picked her up and started comforting her. Part of me became a little scared that she might falsely attribute the accident to me. But, in some ways, I am also grateful for the bumps and bruises. While comforting her, I don't think I was coddling her. I was there, supportive, telling her she could cry as long as she needed to and that I'd be here for all of it. I pat her back and told her how proud I was the entire time she cried and I was surprised and proud at how quickly she got over all of it. Her cries took a lot out of her, so afterward, we just relaxed and read books. We ended up reading through her entire library!


* Relaxing On The Bed

Having exhausted her entire library, Noumena became a little bit fussy. I wasn't sure what else to do, so I took her into the bedroom to lay with me and Chalmers on the bed. We hung out there until bath time.

* Bath & Bed Time

When I tell Noumena it's bath time, she immediately bolts for the bathroom. Abiding by a regular schedule for so long has made managing Noumena so easy as she's grown. She puts the wash clothes into the tub, and reaches to turn the knob to turn on the faucet, and Daddy's help she succeeds. While the tub fills, we dump in her toys and set a reasonable temperature on the faucet. Then, we head to the bedroom. I've begun taking off her clothes in the bedroom, because once she's removed her clothes, she puts them in the hamper, takes off her diaper with Daddy's assistance, then runs butt-naked with the diaper all the way down the hall to the trash can before doing a 180 and heading right back to the bathroom and the tub.

Bathing Noumena has gotten easier and easier; another convenience I attribute to the consistency of our routines. I no longer need to trick her into letting me rinse her head after I've shampooed her hair. No, she's to big for that now. Now, if I tell her to look up for me to rinse her hair out, she simply does and has become a big help.

More than just being a big help, she's now become spoiled! Demanding I pamper her every bath. She stands automatically for me to wash her private parts, but once that's done, she really loves for me to scrub her arms but /especially/ her legs. She lifts one leg out of the water at a time demanding that I scrub it and her feet. I happily oblige.
e
Putting her toys away has also become a trivial matter. She makes it so simple every time and cleans up perfectly right away. Moreover, when getting her ready for bed, she also helps me put on her clothes and even holds the diaper rash cream bottle while I apply some. She's become exceedingly helpful in all things mundane.

We brush her teeth, and I carry Noumena into her room to fall asleep in my arms. Although Noumena still rests her head against my chest as our bed time playlist plays, she's matured to a point where she no longer wants to be rocked to sleep. May baby has grown out of being cradled in my arms and despite my efforts to have cherished every last moment I rocked her to sleep in my arms, the moments left too soon and water streams down my face as I write these words. Now she just wants to lay in her bed to go to sleep, so every night, I lay her down and caress her until she's gone off into a wonderful slumber.

I love you, Noumena. I hope you sleep well.

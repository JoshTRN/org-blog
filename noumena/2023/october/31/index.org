* Good Morning, Noumena!

Today, Noumena wakes me making noises in her bedroom which is unusual for her. Of course she's not really making a fuss, just babbling loud enough for me to hear it from my bedroom. Since she's obviously not in any sort of negative mood, I have plenty of time to prepare her porridge and even poor myself a cup of coffee before going in to greet her good morning. We sit down to eat and I'm mostly spoon feeding her porridge, but she's drinking from her bottle herself. Surprised at how much water she's drunk, I refill her cup with soymilk. She eagerly finished the entire bowl of porridge, a portion that would easily satisfy an adult. Once done, squirms to be let to the floor and proceeds to play with Chalmers attempting several times to plant kisses on him.

After getting washed up, I dress Noumena in slightly warmer clothes than usual as the morning seemed a bit chilly. We hopped in the car to drive to daycare, and as I anticipated, she was cheerful and content the entire ride.

* Daycare Dropoff

We arrive just as the rest of Noumena's class is headed out to the playground, so I set her down and she runs right up to one of the staff members. Once she realizes I'm not following her, however, she worries and lets out a few cries. They subside shortly thereafter and I take the clothes and wipes I had brought to her classroom cubby in case she needs them. As I'm leaving, I see Noumena through the glass door and decide to just observe her for a while before exiting. When walking to my car, I peer at her through the fence continuing to watch and film her play with her friends. There's nothing more enjoyable in this world than seeing her enjoy herself.

* Daycare Pickup

Finally! Work is through and it's time to pick Noumena up. Since it's Halloween, Noumena's mother wants to take Noumena trick or treating in the owl costume she'd bought for Noumena earlier this month, so she asks me to pick her up before accompanying me to pick Noumena up from daycare. When we arrive, Noumena, teeming with energy, is bouncing up and down near the padded blocks with one of her classmates. She's showing off to Mommy and Daddy, so I begin filming her. Once she's ready, she runs straight to Mommy and Daddy!

We load Noumena into the car and drive home. Once we're they, I instruct mommy to feed Noumena leftover tofu scramble and rice giving me time to lay down since I've been tired and dealing with an obnoxious cough.

* Tidewater Acres Park

My cough becomes too much to handle at some point, so I invite Mommy to walk with me and Noumena the CVS at the corner so I can get some cough suppressant. Once we obtain my medicine, I ask Mommy if she wants to accompany us to Tidewater Acres park and she agrees, so Noumena rides atop my shoulders on our way there. Assuming that Noumena would be interested in scaling the slides the way she has been at all the other parks we frequent, so that's our first stop. She's unfortunately unable to scale them since the slide is slicker than the others and she also has dirt on the bottom of her shoes providing no grip.

I set her on the platforms to let her go down the slide, but before doing so, she wants to jump into Daddy's arms. She does this 3 times before going down the slide and I want to show Mommy how much Noumena trusts Daddy, so I prompt her to watch how brave Noumena is for jumping into my arms. After she goes down the slide a few times, we make our way to the swings and swing until the mosquitoes have become too much for Mommy to handle motivating us to walk home.

On our way home, Noumena notices a patch of small yellow flowers. Her mother insists that she's interested in picking them up, so I set her on the ground as Mommy guides her to the flowers and they pick a few together before making our way back.

* Trick Or Treating

Mommy had asked her friends where the best places to trick or treat were and they tell her it's a place close to her house, so we make our way to that area of town with Noumena dressed lightly because her owl costume is hot. Once we find the first house we can trick or treat at, I remove Noumena from the car, plop her onto the trunk of my car and we don her owl costume for us to start heading door to door.

On the way home from trick or treating, Noumena's contentedness impresses me. She had thrown the toys away from her car seat and as we rode home, she didn't fuss at all. Periodically, glanced back to check if she had dozed off, but to my surprise, she remained awake, sitting quietly and peacefully, seemingly enjoying the journey home.


* Bath Time

We get home only 10 minutes before bath time. It's been our routine for a while now that Noumena undresses for her bath in my bedroom. As there's no laundry basket in her room, I help her remove her clothes on my bed. She then gathers her clothes to toss them into the hamper in my closet once she's completely undressed. Witnessing her pick up her clothes from the floor and toss them into the basket, in all her naked innocence, is an utterly priceless and immensely adorable sight.

I coax Noumena to follow me into the bathroom where the bathtub is already being filled with water. However, upon reaching the doorway, she notices me next to the tub and playfully darts down the hall, prompting me to chase after her into the living room. When I catch up to her and manage to place her in the tub, she stands with the water reaching her shins. There's often a brief moment of hesitation as she stands next to me before fully submerging herself. Tonight, as she stands there, I start planting kisses on her cute little belly, a sweet ritual we often share. She's clearly reveling in the affection, so she shifts her body to guide my kisses. She gently tilts down and to her left, bringing her right shoulder closer to my face, all while continuing to enjoy the kisses. Eventually, her head nestles against my shoulder, and I keep on showering her with kisses along the back of her neck. She remains in that relaxed position for perhaps about 10 seconds, allowing me to cherish these heartwarming moments. These are the kind of moments I never want to forget.

Noumena's progress continues to astound me. It feels like just yesterday that shampooing her was a struggle, but as she's grown and become more daring, shampoo time has turned into a minor task. While she hasn't quite grasped how to assist me during the process, she offers minimal resistance, making the whole ordeal quite easy. She also understands when I prompt her to stand, simplifying the remaining washing process. Once we finish, I ask her to stand, wrap the towel around her, and scoop her towel-wrapped body into my arms. As I dry her hair, she catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror and begins to playfully stick out her tongue. Following her lead, I join in, and soon we're both being goofy sticking out our tongues in the mirror.

* Bed Time

After getting Noumena dressed in mismatched pajamas, I take her to brush her teeth and it's time for bed. She had a very busy evening and so falls asleep as I dance holding her against my chest to /Isn't She Lovely/. After briefly singing along, Noumena's asleep within moments, but I continue to hold her against my chest for the duration of the song. I lay her down, holding her hand for the duration of /Stand By Me/. By the time her noise machine turns on, she's knocked out.

Noumena, very few people are going to have their first trick or treat experience documented as thoroughly as yours was. Even though you probably won't be able to remember it, you'll always have the ability to relive it. I love you and am so grateful you had such a wonderful evening. Good night, sweet baby! I'm excited to see you in the morning.

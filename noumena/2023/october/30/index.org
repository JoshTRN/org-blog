* Happy Morning, My Sweet Noumena!

I slept poorly so woke up at about 8:30am. Noumena as usual hadn't made a solitary noise notifying me she was already awake. I heat up her porridge and set it on the dining room table ready for her and make my way to her room. As expected, she's already awake just waiting for Daddy to come in--standing at the corner of her crib nearest the door, blanket in hand ready to toss it out. Noumena is almost fully recovered from her sickness and so it's reflected by the good-natured quality of her mood. She greets the owls as we make our way out of her bedroom and into the dining room to breakfast.

A new part of our morning routine and our routine's in general is washing Noumena's hands. After she finishes eating, I take her to the sink to clean her hands. I'm going to get better about washing and sanitizing our hands. We've been sick far too much for me not to improve our sanitation habits. I wait until we're in her bedroom to wipe her face with a wet wipe. She used to absolutely hate having her face wiped down, but now that Daddy's turned it into a game she loves it and allows me to do quite a thorough job with minimal resistance. Daddy just pretends that the wipe is a monster about to attack her. She attacks back... with her face.

After cleaning up and getting dressed we make our way to daycare. Noumena's amenable to getting in the car seat---her easygoing character shining through. I shower her with kisses after buckling her in. She loves the affection I give her and always reciprocates with the biggest smile you've ever seen on a kids face. She feels so loved and it's my favorite thing in the world.

I read the entries from previous days sometimes and it kills me. All I want to do during the day---especially when we have such awesome weekends together---is spend time with Noumena. I'm so excited to see her every time I go to pick her up! When I arrive at daycare, she's sitting in the corner holding a green oversized Lego block. In short order, she gets up and runs to Daddy. Her diaper is dirty, so before we head out I change her. Recently, change time has become so easy. She understands now that I'm trying to clean her so she's very cooperative and it's a saving grace from when changing was a wrestling match. We finish up, she says goodbye to all her friends and the staff, I load her into the car---she's compliant as ever---and we drive home. Along the way, Daddy sings to her and she sits in her car seat and plays with her toys without the slightest indication of discontent.

* We're Home!

Since I didn't have anything already pre-made, I was thinking about what to feed Noumena and coming up short on ideas. I give her bread as a snack satiate her while I come up with what to prepare. She eats a couple slices and starts trying to feed them to me!

* Walk With Chalmers And Kisa

After a short time, I haven't figured out what I want to make Noumena and I'm debating whether I've fed her enough to go to the park and figure it out later. At some point, I got the idea to take Chalmers on a walk since he rarely goes, so I hoist Noumena onto my shoulders--bread still in hand---leash up Chalmers and we leave the house. Once walking, Kisa---noticing Chalmers has also left with us---feels lonely and decides to accompany us on our walk.

When Kisa follows me for walks, I get paranoid about her losing track of us or getting lost or in a position where she can't find her way back, so we only walk around the block and I prompt Kisa to follow us and we only take a short walk around the block before returning home. I've decided that Noumena's eaten enough that I can take her to the park without worrying that she'll be too hungry, so after putting Chalmers back in the house and locking the door, I load her in for another car ride to Arlingwood Park. Seeing as Noumena's just gotten out of the car, she's less than excited about getting back into the car seat, but her whines are short lived on our way there.

* Arlingwood Park

Upon arrival, we notice our friends Malachai "Kai", 3 and Ezekiel "Zeke", 18 months, who we had met on a previous occasion at the same park. Immediately, Noumena goes for the slide and starts trying to climb it the way she had previously, Kai making a big deal out of following her up the slides. They absolutely love interacting and playing with one another. At some point, Kai takes Noumena's hand as we walk over to visit a pair of Dogs, a golden retriever and older beagle. Kai, being overly excited by the dogs, releases Noumena's hand and runs up to them to pet them. We follow arriving shortly after and Noumena is so gentle with our new canine friends petting them with great care.

Sadly, our friends Zeke and Kai leave while we're still there. For a short time, we're there alone and this is when Noumena takes a huge ass-kicking from the park. Probably the worst she's ever received. First, with Daddy's assistance, she scales a set of curved bars to the platforms on the playground. She makes it all the way to the top and is almost as excited as Daddy is clapping with Daddy as I'm screaming with excitement. I begin to navigate away thinking she's preparing to go down a slide or run around the platforms. This couldn't be further from the truth and I notice that she wants to climb down the very bars she's scaled to get to where she was. They're high and Daddy's not quite prepared to catch her although I do my best. She takes one step onto my hand and tries to step onto another bar unfortunately missing her target and her face softly collides with some of the bars. Of course, I catch her and she starts to cry, so I comfort her and try to distract her until she's ready to play again.

Taking Noumena to the big kids swing, she's feeling much better... but not for long. She's usually so great about hanging onto the chains the swing seat dangles from, but during her swing, she sees something she's distracted by and points towards it losing her balance and taking a tumble onto her back. Honestly, I'm so proud of her. I think these little incidents of her hurting herself are going to be really helpful with her risk evaluation. I pick her up and as I'm comforting her, two new friends, DJ, 3 and Zain 15 mo, arrive  with their mother, Bri. She's completely stopped crying once she sees the other kiddos running around, but when I set her down to play with them, she's not done being comforted by Daddy. I hang onto her for another 5-10 minutes before she decides it's her turn to play as well.

DJ is insanely hyperactive and you can see it in the following video. He's always running around close to Noumena and Noumena is squealing with joy and having the absolute time of her life with these kiddos.

Unfortunately, due to the coming winter months, it's started to darken and it's too dark by the time 7:30pm rolls around so we have to leave. Noumena's not exactly ready to leave when it's time to go---she was having so much fun---but eventually accepts it and acquiesces to my carrying her to the car, but still isn't happy about getting into the car seat.

* Dinner

While driving to the park, I had decided on rice and beans for dinner, so when I get home, I give Noumena a piece of bread, sit her on the couch in front of Ms. Rachel---my electronic babysitter---and begin to prepare the food. Ms. Rachel keeps Noumena pretty well occupied for a decent amount of time while I cook, but she does periodically join me in the kitchen. I tell Noumena several times that she needs to go because it's not safe to be in the kitchen while Daddy cooks and after some reluctance, she obliges leaving me to cook.

It's about quarter after 8pm when we finish and I need to vacuum up the mess. I tried doing it while Noumena was still in the high chair, but she's too afraid of the vacuum, so I clean her down, hold her while I vacuum and we finish out the evening playing in the living room together.

* Bath & Bed Time

Noumena has become phenomenal (the irony does not escape me) during bath time. Shampooing her hair has become effortless and now that she understands directives like "stand" it's so easy to clean her private parts---no trickery or distraction required anymore---I simply ask her and she helps out.

Once we're all clean and I'm getting Noumena dressed---giving her lots of affection, kisses and tickles while she's on her changing table---I can't resist taking photos of her with her hair neatly brushed. We brush her teeth, which she's grown to enjoy so is super helpful in this endeavor, and then I bring her in her room to dance her to sleep.

Of course, Noumena's tuckered out from the play today. She's played so hard I could see her physically exhausted at the park, so she falls asleep immediately even though it seemed just before bed that she still had a ton of energy. She doesn't make it through /Isn't She Lovely/ before being completely passed out as I hug her tightly against my chest---totally in the moment and absolutely enamored with her. I lay her down in her crib and hold her all the way through /Stand By Me/ even though it's unnecessary as she's completely out.

Every day with you is an adventure Noumena and my only regret is that I can't spend more time with you. Thank you for coming into my life. Thank you for bestowing purpose. Thank you for being a wonderful, smart, beautiful, sweet soul. You're the best thing every, baby. I love you. Good night.

* Good Morning, Noumena!

When you're sick, it doesn't feel like only your body is infected, but your life is. I hadn't done a serious grocery haul in a long time between Noumena being sick and me being sick and having to take care of other responsibilities, we'd been eating out a lot. Because of that, I knew last night that I totally didn't have anything for Noumena to eat in the morning, but I did have the ingredients for porridge, so I stayed up late making it. Good. That should last me a few days.

I was awake at 8am and Noumena was still fast asleep, so I rested in bed a little longer. Finally getting up at 8:30am, after breakfast was warm and on the table, it's about 8:50am, and, going to wake her up, notice she's still fast asleep. Just as I approach to wake her, her mother calls telling me she has some boots in my closet that she wants me to bring to her when I drop Noumena off at daycare. Our conversation wakes Noumena who's happy to see me. I think me having woke her up was a pleasant surprise since she's used to being awake and waiting for me to come into the room.

We come to the dining room and start eating and Noumena is apparently ravenous. She finishes a full bowl of porridge in less than 10 minutes! Her uptick in eating has been a welcome change since when she was really sick, she barely ate at all. I get her dressed in her cute blue top with strawberries on it and her red shorts and blue shoes with hearts on them and we leave to daycare. She's in a great mood this morning and carries that wonderful energy the entire car ride to daycare.

When we arrive, I set Noumena right on the ground and she walks with me holding my hand all the way into the building waving at the manatee statue standing outside the front door. We walk all the way to her classroom. She seems like she's used to her classroom and isn't as clingy to Daddy as I expected. We walk into the circle where Noumena's friends are all getting ready to sit down for circle time. Her friend Corina gets up and comes to greet her. Corina also loves me, so she gives me a hug and a high five. Ace, another of Noumena's classmates, sees and demands high fives as well. I turn around to leave and Noumena starts holding me clinging to me---hugging me. I'm going to miss her so much! Poor baby. I wish I didn't have to work and I could just hang out with you and your friends all day!

* With Mommy After Daycare

Mommy texted me telling me she wanted Noumena to see her Halloween costume, so after picking Noumena up, we went to pick up her mother. Mommy was wearing a wig and had pale makeup on and was dressed nothing like usual. I'm not quite sure Noumena recognized Mommy when Mommy got into the car, and Mommy was acting very strange. Noumena stared at her for about 30 seconds before I asked Mommy what she was doing and she told me she was trying to see if Noumena would recognize her. After a little while, it became clear to Noumena that it was her mother under all the strange garb. Mommy wanted to go to the park nearby, so we head there to play for a little while.

After the park, Mommy's house made a haunted house in the backyard and she wanted Noumena to see it, so we took her through the large winding tent and hanging tarps with all the creepy artifacts. It was very large, but we did make our way through rather quickly having Noumena look at all the spooky decorations. When we're done, I get Noumena to kiss Mommy goodbye and we head home.

* Dinner

I'm not sure why, but at some point I really wanted to go to this restaurant named True Food Kitchen that I hadn't been to in a while, so I decided that Noumena would be my date there. We took a quick pit stop at home to change her diaper and wrestle a bit before heading out. It's a long ride there but Noumena is pleasant the entire way, only starting to whine a little just as we arrive.

I chose to sit outside as I usually prefer outdoor dining. The host pulled a chair out for me and asked if I needed a high chair. I said yes and he left to retrieve it, but since the chair was already pulled out, I set Noumena down on it and then sat across from her.

I left Noumena in the same sport even after they had brought a high chair since she seemed comfortable and we ordered while she was still sitting there. When they brought the water, I sat her in the high chair and gave her stuff to drink. Instead of sitting still and waiting for the food, since Noumena seemed like she wanted to wander around, so we walked outside and through the restaurant. We circled back outside, and then saw our food so sat down to eat.

The food was beautiful and amazing! Noumena and I shared a butternut squash pizza and an ancient grains bowl that had all sorts of healthy food in it. She ate a ton. I couldn't rightly let my date go without desert, so we ordered a chocolate chip cookie.

* Courtyard After Dinner

Instead of going straight home after dinner, I took Noumena into the courtyard of the plaza we were in where they have fountains and chairs and all sorts of pretty, well manicured shrubbery. Noumena goes absolutely wild and the evening is truly magical.

There were a set of fraternal twin boys dressed alike also playing in the court yard. Unfortunately, I was occupied helping Noumena jump from chair to chair, so I didn't get a chance to record them all together, but these 2Â½ year old boys were soooo cute. They had a ball, so I dribbled it a little with both them and Noumena and they threw it to each other and it was so much fun. I eventually looked at the time and realized it was very late and I still had to get Noumena home to bathe before going to bed.

* Bath & Bed Time

We head straight for the bath right when we get home because we were already running 10 minutes late. We had so much fun, though! We played a lot with her letters in the bath and she wasn't too apprehensive to getting washed. At the end of it, after we had put away all her toys, she grabbed on of her soap bottles and started squatting and smashing it into the tub.

I get Noumena dressed in her pajamas and literally right as we finish getting her all dressed up, her timed noisemaker comes on signifying to me that it's 9pm and time for her to already be asleep. I take her to brush her teeth and we listen to /Isn't She Lovely/ as I rock her to sleep. She's completely out by the time the song finishes. Nevertheless, when I lay her down in her crib, I hold her hand through the entirety of /Stand By Me/ before getting up and leaving her to dream peacefully.

Noumena, our date tonight was so wonderful. You had some of the brightest smiles I've ever seen and the squeals of joy were unmistakable. I feel so privileged to get to raise you and take you to have nice evenings like this. I hope you dream of our wonderful evening together. I know I will, baby. Goodnight, my precious sweetheart. I'll see you in the morning!

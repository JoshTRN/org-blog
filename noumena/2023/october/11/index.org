* Morning

This morning was absolutely crazy. Last night I had forgotten that I needed to be up early for an early meeting at work. I had set my alarm early, but instead of snoozing it I just stopped it from ringing again. Noumena didn't wake me up until 9am and my meeting was at 9:30am!!! I rush to get her fed and dressed and join my meeting with her in tow.

I stood at my desk, tried to listen and she would continually play with my keyboard on my other computer. This soon became untenable because I had to stop Noumena from messing around with the things on my desk, but when I set her on the ground, she would get too upset and demand to be held. I thought maybe if I set her in her crib for a few minutes she'd be okay playing with her toys, but this was a huge mistake. I couldn't tolerate her screaming in there--it just didn't feel right--so I had to figure something else out. I grabbed her toys, sat down in my office and started biting her with her toy hippo and lion. This kept her entertained and I was able to pay attention to the rest of the meeting.

I had to leave to get right back to work, so I took Noumena to daycare in a hurry and rushed back home to continue my work day.

* Taking Noumena Home From Daycare

As usual, when I arrive and Noumena notices me, she rushes over to arms outstretched to see me only to be cut off by a little boy named Ace. Startled, she moves around him and I pick her up. She waves bye to everyone as we leave together and head out to the car.

During the Car ride home I've begun to notice that Noumena seems to be a lot more comfortable than she used to. She'll play with her owl---kissing it several times as she did today---read her books play with her toys or talk and make noises. She made a lot of noises today. We've been taking a different route home for the past week due to construction on one of the convenient bridges making commute somewhat longer. As we're stopped at a light that's not along our typical route, I look back and Noumena turns her head towards me. She reaches her hand back towards me and I reach mine back as well. I'm reminded as she looks into my eyes how much I love her. The real travesty in all of this is the number of missed opportunities I have to get lost so deeply in her beautiful, dark brown eyes. This isn't one of those missed opportunities. I'm entranced and in love. The stop light is a long one and there's so much traffic allowing us exchange several high fives and eventually I let her bite my hand softly and make noises. Both activities draw laughter out of her and it's a joyous ride home.

* Tidewater Acres Park

When we arrive at home, I take her inside, but she doesn't seem to want to be, so we leave for the park right away. I figure I'll make dinner for us later. I hoist her upon my shoulders and we take off. On our route, she's not exactly happy, but the groans she lets out are fairly soft and certainly haven't reached the level of cries. I mimic her pitch which ends up calming her for an unknown reason. I actually prompt her to keep groaning because I wanted to harmonize her groans, but she's become contented and remains so all the way until we're at the park.

When we arrive at the park, there's a couple sitting down and eating joined bar a large grayish-white cat I'm fairly confident we've seen before. I initially thought that the cat belonged to the couple, but it became apparent that he didn't as the man stood from the bench to throw away his scraps causing the cat to increase its distance. The man set a wrapper on the ground for the cat to pick it. It's here I crouched and next to the cat, Noumena balanced on my knee, and we just observe him eating until the temptation builds compelling Noumena to approach the cat. He runs away from her and she chases him out of the park. I redirect her back into the park by chasing her, she picks up the wrapper, throws it away and we start to play.

Noumena doesn't usually grip me in anyway when she travels atop my shoulders, but today, for some unclear reason, she's hugging Daddy's head as we approach our home. I wouldn't trade these moments for the world.

* Dinner

I haven't been meal prepping since my sickness and so I've been overly reliant on quick and easy to prepare foods. Today it was pasta and buttered bread. Chalmers got a good meal out of it because despite thinking Noumena would be very hungry, she only ate a small portion instead opting to move it back and forth from her tray into the cup holder and back again and eventually throwing a decent amount of it on the floor for Chalmers to scavenge. I suppose she was just looking out for him.

* Picking Up Medicine

On the way home from picking up Noumena from the daycare, I was informed that the grocery store near me could fill my prescription for much cheaper using GoodRx since the medication bizarrely enough was not covered by my insurance, so I went there to pick it up. They hadn't filled it when I got there and told me it wouldn't be ready for 30 minutes. Since she had just been in the car, I didn't want to put Noumena back in the car seat, drive home just to stay there for ten minutes to do it all again, so I decided to take her for a stroll around the nearby neighborhood. Noumena didn't want to be on my shoulders and gave quite fuss so I would let her walk around on the streets near people's yards. She didn't even want to be led by the hand. She's very independent and I let her exercise it as much as was reasonable for our walk, but the trip back to the store was rather unpleasant for her until I started high fiving her and biting her hands as we arrived. We picked up the prescription, I let her carry it on our way back to the car, and we headed back.

* Hanging Out At Home

I think she was getting really tired by the time we got home, but she wasn't throwing a tantrum. She laid on the ground the same way she would if she were about to throw a tantrum, but instead laid there, staring at Daddy and I took the opportunity to be affectionate with her.

We wrestled a lot on the bed this evening, but this is when I knew she was really tuckered. At some point she stopped and closed her eyes laying on the bed. I let her have a very brief rest before picking her up and continuing our play. As we're playing, she begins to say "Daddy" and I'm freaking out about it having so much fun.

* Bath & Bed Time

My usual trick in the bath hasn't been working. I think she's wised up to me using her distraction with the faucet to distract her while I shampoo and rinse her. It's become difficult again. Maybe I'll figure out a new trick one of these days. She has, however, gotten a lot better at putting her toys away in a timely manner at the end of bath time. Every cloud has a silver lining, I suppose. After bath, I get her dressed in her one piece pajamas, brush her teeth and head into her bedroom to put her to sleep.

As I said previously, Noumena was really tuckered so she fell asleep immediately. Recently, though, when I lay her into the crib, she seldom rolls over and goes right to sleep. Instead, the difference in height causes her to wake briefly. Thankfully, she no longer needs to be picked up from laying down if she gets startled awake. Now she's content to be caressed in her crib while she falls asleep. In fact, tonight, I stopped caressing and only rested my hand against her in order to reassure her of my presence until she's completely fallen asleep. If I remove my hand before she's asleep, however, she begins a mild whine that will turn into a big commotion if left ignored. So, it's imperative that I rest my hand against her until she's full asleep, but when she is, she sleeps hard. We finish our playlist as I rest my hand against her.

Noumena every day you remind me how important to me you are. You're my motivation to do better in this world. I know at least some of the things I need to do to be a better father and will continue to work tirelessly to be the best father possible to you. I'm sorry it's been difficult for me to write these entries lately, but I will pick back up the pace and give you the childhood memories you deserve.

I love you, baby. Please know what I'm trying so hard and I will continually improve.

Good night, sweetheart. I hope all your dreams are as pleasant and wonderful as it was the day you came into my life. You are my everything. Please know that.

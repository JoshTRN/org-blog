* Morning

I've gotten used to waking up rather late for better or worse. Noumena never whines anymore when she awakens. Most mornings, I don't even know how long she's been awake before I enter to pull her out of bed. This gives me plenty of time to make sure her breakfast is ready before I retrieve her from her bed. Today it's instant oatmeal. I've been adding a splash of maple syrup just to sweeten the deal for her. As I'm sure is the case with most parents, I have some misgivings about the amount of sugar she consumes, but at the same time, I want her to enjoy her meals. A little bit of maple syrup in the morning shouldn't really hurt... I hope.

I remember before Noumena could walk when I would enter her room in the morning, she would be elated to see me. Recently however, I don't often get greeted with a smile. Although I'm confident that it doesn't mean anything, still, in some ways it feels like a failure on my part as though maybe she's not as happy as she should be. I want her to be excited when she sees me in the morning. Maybe I'll try making a bigger deal out of it tomorrow. I'm certain if I start acting like a goofball, she'll have to smile!

Noumena outstretches rolls over onto her back and outstretches her arms expectantly---non-verbally saying, "You know the drill, Daddy." I pick her up, give her several of the usual morning kisses and we sit down to eat breakfast together before getting her dressed and leaving for the day. Noumena is in a pleasant mood the entire to daycare and when we arrive, I set her on the sidewalk and she walks with me all the way into the building and to her class room.

* Evening

I didn't go grocery shopping over the weekend and I needed to figure something out for dinner, so I left work a little early to get pasta and sauce so we could have that for dinner and proceeded to Noumena's daycare to pick her up. She's as happy as ever when I get there to see her and rushes to the gate to the moment she lays eyes on me. Her friend seemingly wanted affection as well, so she hesitantly came up to us as I was crouched down holding Noumena. I asked her if she wanted a hug too, and then she came in for one; it was so precious.

Noumena says bye to all her friends and teaches as we exit the building make our way to the car. Despite the traffic jam on the way, Noumena did phenomenally---she barely whined at all and was content almost the entire way home.

Kisa is playing in the yard upon our arrival, so naturally I set Noumena down to play with her and we wander around the yard a bit before Kisa travels across the street. Noumena, of course, follows closely behind, but when she approaches the street I grab her hand, stop her, point at the ground and say "street" then point both directions and say "cars" and "no." I'm not sure how best to communicate it right now. It's strange; she understands that heights are dangerous. She's even afraid of unfamiliar animals that approach her suddenly, but she has no concept of worry around cars. I'm not quite sure how to teach that they're literal death machines, but I'm doing my best with the little communication tools I have at my disposal right now.

Having prevented Noumena from entering the street, I hoist her up into my arms and bring her into the house to prepare dinner.

* Dinner

I carry in the groceries with me and set them down on the stove top ready for prepping. I take Noumena's socks and shoes off and set her down in the living room so I could cook dinner. Remarkably, she's not as clingy as usual and somehow keeps herself entertained---playing with an empty diaper box and a Buzz Lightyear toy to ride on---long enough for me to boil the water. She does eventually find her way into the kitchen, however, and will not be satisfied until Daddy is paying her attention. I spend the rest of my time cooking with my right hand, Noumena affixed to my hip, my left arm holding her in place. It's not easy or necessarily the safest to cook this way, but I could manage it since it was such a simple dish and honestly, I just love spending time with her so it was a pleasure.

* Spending Time At Home

I try very carefully to get Noumena good and clean directly after meals to prevent a messy toddler from spreading the mess to the other corners of the house, but unfortunately today I was less than successful in my endeavors... and I happened to wearing white. Noumena left a big, tomato-sauce hand-print on my white shirt just before I got her to the sink to wash her hands. Worrying about it staining, I decided to change and wash my shirt immediately, I moved some of my dirty clothes into the laundry basket and brought it into Noumena's room because she had a bunch of laundry that needed doing anyway. I set the basket down, starting putting in the clothes, prompted Noumena to follow suit and then while she was putting her dirty clothes into her laundry basket in her room, I changed my shirt in the other room. When I came back in, I helped her finish putting the clothes in the basket, then I put her in the basket and carried her to the washing machines.

* Visiting Ms. Theresa

It gets dark so early these days and the days are only going to get shorter. It was about 6:30pm and I really wanted to take her to the park, so as soon as I put Noumena's laundry in, we left so I could take her to the park. Upon exiting, we noticed Ms. Theresa sitting on her porch, so we went over for a brief visit. Once Noumena got down and started pulling me over toward our house though, I knew she wanted to go to the park as well. We said goodbye to Ms Theresa and headed out.

* Pumpkin Patch

[[file:holding-gourd-2.jpg]]



On our way to the park, I noticed a pumpkin patch just outside a church. Of course, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to take her there, so as I passed the church, I turned the car around, pulled into the parking lot and we walked over to explore taking in all the pumpkin diversity from big ones to small ones and star shaped ones and bumpy and bruised looking pumpkins.

I was unfamiliar with gourds, so we stopped by the booth where they were selling the pumpkins and, introduced myself and Noumena to a woman named Paula and a man named Lee, I asked about them. They gave Noumena a sticker which she removed almost instantly after I put it on her shirt and handed it back to Lee. They gave us another sticker for the road and we left for the park.

* Arlingwood Park

I generally perceive Arlingwood Park as much more enjoyable for Noumena than Tidewater Acres which is why I decided to go here today. It sucks that it's already getting dark, but we try to make the best of it. There's a little girl hanging from a circular bar affixed to a ball bearing allowing it to rotate. That's the bar I let Noumena free hang from every time we go to that park. I'm trying to get her to do pull ups from a very young age firstly, because I think it's cool and secondly I want her to be physically strong. We wait for the little girl to move on before I set her on there.

Most of our time, however is spent on the slides. I've habituated Noumena into climbing up the slides. With my help, she can do it and she /always/ wants to. Despite her right shoe (it's always the right one) falling off multiple times while she climbs having to fall, sit back down and adjust, she makes it up the slide several times. Daddy claps and yells in celebration every time she reaches the top and Noumena joins in the celebration clapping along before demanding Daddy help her to go back down the slide so we can do it all again!

We swung and climbed and run and Noumena definitely got worn out tonight. She wasn't excited when we got to the car, understanding that we were gong home, but with Daddy acting goofy outside the car door after she was strapped into her car seat, she definitely calmed down and enjoyed the ride home as we listened to /On Impulse/ by *Animals As Leaders* on the way.

* Back At Home

Recently, one of the workers at Noumena's daycare told me that they wanted me to read to her more often. I, of course, want to read to her all the time, so remembering that, the first thing I set out to do when we got home was have her pick out a book. I got all her books down from where they're stored and got her to pick a few out. As I expected, she went for the little, first words books that have the pictures with the words they're showing. We read the animals and birds book before she moves on to a Christmas popup book.

After a while, she's disinterested in reading, so I just let her play with her toys in the living room. Eventually, Noumena makes her way to the kitchen and is asking for bread. When I give it to her, she takes it into the living room and starts teasing Chalmers with it. She thinks it's funny. During one of her attempts at teasing, Chalmers is just too fast for her and snakes the bread away from her which turns into a full blown fit. For a little while, I just let her deal with the consequences of her actions and cry, but of course, her cries wear daddy down and I have to comfort her.

I think that Noumena's also probably very tired which makes it difficult to calm her down. She's dissatisfied with everything and is letting the world know through her cries. I'm not sure what to do exactly, but what I end up doing that works is laying her on the bed and every time she cries, I roll around with her and cry the same pitch as her while rolling with her in my arms. Eventually, this just turns to wrestling on the bed which we do for a very long time up until it's time for her bath.

* Bath & Bed Time

Noumena's been disinterested in the tub's faucet recently which removes one of my parenting hacks for shampooing her, but she does seem to be maturing enough to simply recognize that she needs to be cleaned. While she's not exactly happy about being shampooed undistracted, she doesn't start crying about it immediately and needing to be comforted like she used to. We listen to music while I bathe her and she helps me put away her toys as usual when we're done. She waves by to herself in the mirror as I carry her to her bedroom to get dressed.

I dress her in her owl pajamas and she doesn't give me any fuss tonight, which I'm grateful for. I take her back to the bathroom, we brush her teeth and feed the pets before going back into her room. She's become a master at brushing her teeth. It seems like an odd thing to think of as a skill, but you do have to habituate yourself to not biting and just allowing the brush to glide across your teeth. She seems to grasp the purpose of teeth brushing now so it's much easier to do.

We dance to /Isn't She Lovely/ and she's completely out not even halfway through the song. Recently, she's been needing me to stay close to her after I set her in her crib, but I think we were so active at the park tonight she went right to sleep without hesitation. I sat next to her crib, reached my hand through the bars and held it until /Stand By Me/ had finished playing and left her to enjoy her beauty rest.


Noumena, I'm sorry my sickness had taken so much out of me and made it so hard to write these journal entries. I love you so much, sweetheart and I will continue working every day to make sure you understand that you are my whole world and the whole purpose of this life for me right now is to make you feel loved, and protected, and safe, and happy. Good night, precious. Have the sweetest dreams imaginable!

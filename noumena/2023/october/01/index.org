* Morning

Today Noumena's mother came over early and woke her up. She had already been awake a little while in the crib but wasn't fussing too much and I knew her mother was coming over so I just let her hang out in there until her mother arrived. Her mother brought her breakfast from McDonald's. After they finished eating, She brought Noumena in to give me a pleasant awakening!

We spent some time prepping and then head out for a beach day while the weather was still warm enough to get in the water!

* Beach Day!

Since I know the directions to the beach, I never use GPS to navigate there. Had I used GPS, I would have known that there was a coastal flooding risk! I only discovered this later when I looked on the GPS to search for food for lunch. When we arrived at the beach, the water was higher up the shore than I'd ever seen it and I'd been there at this same time before so I don't think it was tidal. The waves were also higher than I'd every seen. The beach was covered with seafoam from the tumultuousness of the sea. I had never really seen billows of seafoam before. It was a good experience to have with Noumena. Of course she loved playing with it.

Since the tide was so high, everyone on the beach was very close to the inlet and the large dune of sand meant to separate the beach from the roads. This is where we set our stuff down. Noumena's mother had brought a shovel because she really wanted to dig a hole.

After applying sun screen, I took Noumena into the waves at a safe distance to play with the seafoam and in the ocean.

I'm not quite sure how Noumena's mind works just yet. Her rationalizations are opaque to me, but after we had finished playing in the water and joined Mommy digging her hole, Noumena began taking the sand that had been dug up and tossing it into the hole. A hole which both Noumena and I had fallen into at one point or another due to the sand surrounding it collapsing when we stood too close to the edge. After, there was a long yellow rope lining the sand dune which demarcated the beach from the dune. For no reason obvious to me, Noumena began throwing sand over the rope---waddling around exposing her bum in the process as her swimsuit was just a little to big and there was no diaper aiding her in holding them up.

* Home

Noumena fell asleep almost immediately once we started driving home. All that beach fun really tuckered her out. The car ride home was almost 30 minutes and apparently that was a long enough nap for her to have a boatload of energy once we're home. I tried getting her to go back to sleep, but I couldn't swing it. I was starting to get hungry and I knew that Noumena needed to eat, so I asked what her mother wanted to eat and we decided on BurgerFi since they have a vegan burger and I went to pick it up for us to eat.

After lunch, I wanted to wear her out, so we her mom left and we went to the park.

* Park

Noumena was surprisingly active at the park considering we were the only ones there. Usually, she's only interested in heading towards the gates which I don't want to encourage because they're so close to the street. Today, however she was totally occupied by the slides. Once I set her on the platforms, she went immediately to the slides and the it became a loop. When she got to the bottom of the slide, she immediately went to the chain ladder to climb back up and do it all over again. Because the first rungs of the ladder were so close to the ground, I allowed her to take those rungs all by herself. The subsequent rungs, I physically supported her only insofar as to protect her from falling. Otherwise, I allowed her complete autonomy in taking the rungs all by herself. I'm stunned at her progress! She barely needed my help at all climbing the ladder!

Allowing her to do the work herself facilitated my aim in wearing her out so she could take another nap, but came with a funny consequence. While scaling the ladder, several times she passed gas on her way up due to the exertion! She even soiled her diaper on one of the trips! But, because she was having such a good time climbing and going back down the slide, I couldn't take her away from it in good conscience. I wanted to leave when she had soiled her diaper but allowed to continue climbing and sliding until she decided she was done with it and went along to do something else. At which point, I took her home to change her and lay her down for a nap.

I laid Noumena down for a nap at about 10 minutes until 5pm and she slept until 6:30pm.

* Home

I had initially planned on feeding her the protein oatmeal I had made last night for breakfast, but since her mother already fed her, it was left in the fridge, so I decided that would be her dinner. when she woke up, she ate almost the entire bowl herself! She was ravenous! Subsequently, we washed her hands together and sat to read, reading several books. I was a bit worried that she wouldn't be tired come bed time, so I took her back to the park after a little while playing with Chalmers.

* Park II

On our way to the park, the owners of our friend Harley had just gotten home, so we waited for them to let her out to come say hi to Noumena. Harley barking and making a scene is one of Noumena's favorite things. The squeals she lets out when Harley is running about and barking are priceless. I wouldn't trade them for anything in the world.

Noumena had so much fun the last time going down the slides, that she spent a fair amount of time going down the slides, but shortly after heads towards the gate. Since I want to discourage that behavior, I'm starting to instill the consequence that whenever she goes to exit the gates, that means it's time to leave. Since she's old enough to learn and understand, that will be the consequence every time we go to the park from now on. Thankfully, leaving doesn't upset her at all and since we have a little bit of time, she rides atop my shoulders the long way home.

* Home From The Park

We arrived at home at about 8:15pm giving us a bit of time to hang around before bath time. I set Noumena down on the floor right away and she collapsed to the ground in a upright seated position. I was convinced that this would result in a fit or crying, but it didn't at all. Instead, she seemed content to sit. With her seated, I prompted her to remove her own shoes. Starting with unstrapping the velcro, I got her to detach both straps and then tried to get her to remove her shoes from the heel first. It took a little bit of help---I would slide the heel down a little before letting her push the rest of the way. I then focused on her toes telling her to pull from the end of the shoe. When she succeeded I clapped with glee telling her that she did it! It was the exact same story with the other shoe and both socks. She learning so quickly and I'm so proud of her.

I lazed about until her bath time, but she was up and wondering around. Picking on Chalmers and just wondering.

* Bath & Bed Time

I took Noumena to bath time about 5 minutes late. Instead of carrying her to the bath, I let her work out what I meant when I told her it was bath time and she led the way to the tub where we drew her bath. Soon enough, she'll be drawing the bath herself. I often set Noumena in the bath tub while the faucet is still pouring. When I do, she always ventures to the faucet to place her hands under it and interrupt the stream thereof. This affords me the perfect opportunity to both shampoo her hair /and/ rinse it out all at the same time. She frequently gets upset when I do that, but given that she's so entranced by the stream of water, she hardly reacts when I shampoo it and even when rinsing it, she makes much less of a fuss. Washing her body is usually fairly easy, so no distraction needs to be implemented when doing that, but I think so far the tub faucet is the most useful tool in my bath time tool belt.

Since we went to bath time late, there's very little time before putting her to bed after her bath has concluded. I dress her in her Halloween pajamas, bush her teeth---something she's really gotten the grip of and almost never fights anymore---and bring her into her room to listen to our playlist while she falls asleep on my chest. I quickly move to cradling her in my arms, and somewhat as I predicted given I had let her nap so late, she remains awake. It's okay, though, because in these moments in the dark when she can still somehow make out my face in the dark room and picks out my facial features as I periodically kiss her are so intimate and gratifying that I'm happy she hasn't quite succumb to exhaustion.

We get through /Isn't She Lovely/ and /Stand By Me/ before she's even fallen asleep. I don't lay her down until halfway through /Just The Two Of Us/ and when I do, she's perfectly content. She doesn't move a muscle nor make a peep when I lay her down.


You are the light of my life Noumena.

I love you.

Good night.

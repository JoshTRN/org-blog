* Morning

Noumena gave me plenty of sleep last night. I woke up before her this morning which is really rare. I think she started stirring at 7am, but I didn't get out of bed right away to get her. When I did get out of bed, she stopped stirring so I laid back down. I got out of bed at around 8:10am and Noumena was still not awake. This gave me plenty of time to warm her porridge and get ready before I ever even went in to wake her up. It would be nice if it were this easy all the time.

* Dinner

When we get home from daycare, soup is on the menu again. After she's done with soup, I give her a date as desert while she was still sitting in her high chair. She throws it to the ground so I start cleaning her up. I get her off the high chair, wipe off some of the star noodles that got stuck on her shirt and call Chalmers over to eat them. Noumena stands there watching as he cleans up the stars and he proceeds to eat the date she had dropped on the floor. After Chalmers eats it, Noumena decides it was hers, so she gets jealous and starts making a little scene. I give her another date and she starts flaunting it in front of Chalmers trying to make him jealous. I caught a little bit of it on camera.

* Living Room

We're going to be staying inside for at least a little while because of the rain. After dinner, she toddles over to her chair that she loves so much, picks up her begin and begins reading. I go over to read with her.

After we're finished reading, she wanders back and fourth into and out of Daddy's arms

At some point, she makes her way to the couch and grabs my headset. She starts headed my way, so I figure she's smart enough to bring it to me. I absolutely love how smart she's getting.

After a while she makes her way over to her toy train. I pull it out and start running around with her on it which turns out to be a really intense glute workout.

We also take some time to wrestle.

* For a walk


We do eventually go outside. Noumena and I both get stir crazy, so we have to go for a walk.

We bring the umbrella and notice that Noumena is afraid of it, which is very entertaining.

* Back home

Coming home from our walk, she's I carry her in my arms because on my shoulders she's getting a bit fussy because she's tired. Once we're home, I go to relax with her on the bed... relaxation turns into wrestling.

* Living Room Part 2

It's too late to allow Noumena to go to bed, so I have to figure something out to keep her awake. My first thought is one of those fruit pouches. I know she won't sleep if she has something tasty to much on, so I grab one out of the pantry and we head back to the living room to eat.


** Laundry

Oksana had done the laundry, but when the dryer is done, Noumena helps me fold the clothes.

** Playing

She's gotten so good at tossing things to daddy we play with her toy for a little while

** Dancing

First we start dancing crazy once I turn the music on

Then I chase her down the hall

** Drinking water

I get thirsty from all the running around, so we end up sharing a water together. She tries putting the bottle cap on herself because of course she's smart enough to know where it goes.

* Bed time Routine

8:30 comes around and it's her bath time. We bundle her up after her bath, brush her teeth, drink a little more water, and dance together. She falls asleep on Daddy's chest. As I carry her in to her room, I'm not done holding her so I lay her in my arms, rock her and give her kisses for another five minutes before laying her in bed.

I hope you sleep well, my lovely little girl!

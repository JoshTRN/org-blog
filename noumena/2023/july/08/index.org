* Morning

When I first became a father, maybe a few months in, I, like I assume most parents, read numerous articles about various parenting questions you have. Google becomes your best friend as you frantically search every time you think you could be doing something wrong and it's often hard to weigh the arguments especially because a lot of the studies are inconclusive or old. I can't remember the exact article this came from, but something that stuck with me ever since I read it was talking about knowing your baby's different types of cry. For example, there were different types of cries for hunger, sleepiness, pain, etc. I wasn't sure at the time what it meant... I thought all Noumena's cries sounded the same. I'm not sure when it changed, but it did and I totally recognize different types of cries these days.

It was another 7:30am wake up this morning. When she first started sleeping through the night, she would cry, but it was almost as if she was not even awake while crying. And if you went in there, if you were quiet, she wouldn't even open her eyes. That was the type of cry I noticed this morning. It's hard to describe but it's faint and peters out very slowly. I thought she would go back to sleep, but I'm wrong, so I go in and get her. When I get her out of her crib, as usual we visit the owls. Today, when I say it, she */repeats after me/*. I was so excited! I got her to repeat after me 2 more times almost as though "Owl" is her first word! So exciting!

For breakfast, we have porridge made from rice, sweet potatoes, apples and soy milk. And, as usual, dates for desert. We hang out and read her words book a couple times before we head to the library earlier than usual to meet mom.

* Library

We were late meeting mom because the Matthews bridge was closed down. It's almost as though I have to check google any time I think I'm going to head over it. It seems so random whenever they shut it down.

We go right into story time when we. There was no letter of the day today for story time and I don't even think there was a sign today. All the stories were about dancing. After story time, we go out to the courtyard, hang out by the fountains a little bit and then head into the play room where Noumena solves puzzles and plays with Mommy.

* Children's Hands-On Museum

[[file:with-mommy-in-museum.jpg]]

After we meet mom at the children's museum and it was so much fun. We're going to have a lot of great memories there as she grows. We go all over that place and Noumena plays with everything. One of the first thing we head towards is the trains and I get a video of mommy playing with her.

After, we head towards the baby room and spend most of our time there. She meets lots of friends and I get a photo of this face she makes I've been trying to get forever. It's so beautiful.

* Back Home

I tell Oksana to heat up soup as we head back home so Noumena can eat right away. I know she's going to want to go to sleep because she's had such a busy morning, but I want to make sure she gets well fed before taking a nap so I can nap at the same time. She sleeps for about an hour and a half, and we get close to the cutest pose ever after she wakes up. We tried to get the cuter picture, but we were just not fast enough.

* Beach

[[file:walking-closeup.jpg]]

When we get to the beach, she's apparently forgotten what it's like since the last time we were here.
She starts off afraid and whines a lot at the start. But I spend time close to her making sure she's safe and eventually after wandering back onto the sand where it's safe, she starts to venture off on her own. She become so independent that while she's playing in the sand, she ends up sticking a whole wad of wet sand into her mouth. I tried to wipe away as much as I could, but the damage was done and she seemed to enjoy it as she crunched down on the sand with a huge smile on her face and sand in between her teeth. She must have swallowed a good amount... I hope she's okay.

We leave at the perfect time---just before it starts to rain. When we get leave, we find a patch of grass and I change her into clothes that we're going to dinner in. She's so easy to deal with while she's laying on the grass. Super easy to change. She's been really easy with changing in general these days. It's so great.

* Dinner

At dinner, we go to a nice place called True Food Kitchen that has a lot of vegan options. Oksana gets a vegan pizza and I get a bunch of veggies in a bowl. Noumena shares both of our dishes and she loves both the pizza and the mixed veggie bowl. We also share pink lime tart dessert with her. There's a little courtyard right there, so we hang out and I snap a totally manufactured pic of her relaxing on these chairs that are there.

* Park

We get back and head immediately to the park. Today is turning out to be a super eventful day for Noumena. Noumena wanted to go down the twirly slide and, for the first time seemed almost brave enough to do it. I went to help her out, but I'm not as tall as that slide so I couldn't reach her. She had to take a leap of faith and dare to go down the slide herself until Daddy could reach her. She takes the leap and Daddy catches her hand and I am just so proud of her.

We take the long way back home.

* Home

Once we're home, I get Noumena some soymilk, we read her book and hang out on the bed until bath time.

* Bed Time

Bed time is as it usually is, but sometimes I'm stricken with emotion and tear up while I'm holding her and dancing with her because I love her so much. Tonight is one of those nights where I'm tearing up as I'm dancing with her and she falls asleep in my arms.

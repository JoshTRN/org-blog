* Morning

When Noumena wakes up at 7:30am, she starts immediately playing the blanket game with me. I had already heated up her porridge so it was waiting for her. After I pick her up out of the crib, I notice immediately that her diaper is extremely full. The first thing that needs to be done is Noumena needs to be changed. I change her right into her swimsuit as today is water day at daycare.

After she gets changed, I feed her and we hang out in the living room for a little while while I bemoan the fact that I have to take her to daycare. I pack up her extra set of clothes and we head out.

While we've been driving, we've both gotten in the habit of reaching back to grab each others hands. Sometimes I gently caress her hand. Other times I'm giving high fives to her. And other times still she's just shaking it and trying to nibble on them lightly to hear the sound I make. I feel profoundly connected to her when we play like this.

Arriving at daycare, there are these little pillow rings one of the little girls is playing with. While holding Noumena, I hunker down and play with the rings with this little girl and put them first on her head, then on mine, then on Noumena's head like a hat. Eventually Noumena gets tired of me holding her so she wiggles to get down. When she's down, she realizes that I'm going to leave so she starts crying. I kiss her on the head, say I'm sorry and start walking away. Before I get that far, Noumena stops crying. I look back at her and tell her I'm so proud of her for not crying so much! But, her noticing I'm still there makes her cry just a little more.

* Picking Up Noumena

I miss Noumena what seems like more and more each day. I think about her so frequently it interferes with my work honestly. Because I can get away with it, I take off at 4:30pm to pick her up a little early from daycare. When I get there to pick up Noumena, she has a bag with her swim suit and sheets they cover her nap pad with so I grab that and take her outside. I realize I've never really spent any time in the courtyard of where her day care is and I see a large white fountain in the distance in the center of the courtyard so Noumena and I go to check it out. Noumena is so fascinated with the trees as we walk back.

I realize we've forgotten Noumena's pink blanket, so we re enter the daycare to grab it. When we get back in, one of the little guys is holding the foam rod the pillow rings goes over and he tries to hand it to me. I grab it and start swinging it around my head. As I try to give it back to him, he wont' take it. One of the little girls takes it and then all of a sudden he wants it back. This is all occurring while I'm holding Noumena and her blanket.

Another little girl has a book of animals and clearly wants me to read it to her, So I grab it from her and walk over to one of the foam boxes to sit on while the kids gather around and we make animal sounds and flip pages together. Noumena is starting to get a little jealous and it is so cute. She clearly wants Daddy all to herself as she's been without him all day. After we're done reading, I give the book back and we take off.

Traveling back, Noumena is in a super good mood which is so awesome. She doesn't give me any hard time in the car at all.

* Home

As usual, the first thing we do when we get home is eat. Soup is on the menu today finishing off with a couple of dates for desert. Later, I called Chris and asked if he wanted to hangout since it's been so long since he's seen Noumena. He of course agrees so Noumena and I hang out until it's time to go meet Chris.

* Dinner and Riverside Park

Chris wants to eat, so we agree to meet him at a place called Cava that has these really good bowls with lots of vegan options. I get a bowl with black lentils, basmati rice, red pepper hummus, tomatoes, corn, falafel and cucumber with some of their vinegarette. I try to get Noumena to eat some of the stuff, but all she wants to try to do is feed me. It's probably because she's basically still full.

Afterward, we walk right down to the river and there's a playground there. We spend the rest of the night playing with Chris.

* Bath and Bed Time


We leave just in time to get back for bath time. She got pretty tuckered out and fell asleep just 5 minutes before we got home. I thought for sure she'd be cranky waking up 5 minutes later, but she was in a great mood all day. I put some of the laundry in the dryer so it's done a little after Noumena goes to sleep and we draw her a bath.

After bath, we brush her teeth, feed the pets and dance until she passes out in my arms.

I hope you had fun today Noumena and I'm so excited for our weekend together.

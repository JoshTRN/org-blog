* Morning

I wake up at 8am and haven't heard anything from Noumena. I snooze the alarm and get out of bed at 8:05am. After preparing Noumena's porridge and myself some coffee, I pick her up out of her room and take her to the dining room to eat. After eating, Noumena sees Kisa, so I set her down and she runs up to Kisa to greet her good morning. After a little while, I have to use the restroom, so I distract Noumena with her books that she loves so much and go. When I exit, I see her still enthralled and we play in the living room very briefly before I get her dressed and ready to go to daycare.

* Daycare

* The Drive Home

It started to rain just before I left to pick up Noumena, so I brought the umbrella with me to get her. There was an accident on the bridge going the opposite direction that I saw on my way, so I know I'm going to have to take an alternative route home. I pack Noumena into the car, turn on the music and tell her that she might want to take a nap since it's a long ride home. She falls asleep at about 5:30pm and we're going to get home in about 17 minutes according to the GPS. Since I want her to take a decent nap, I decide to take an extra long route thinking if she gets a good nap, she'll be in a better mood. Little did I know...

* Home

When we get home, Noumena is not in a great mood right away. I try feeding her, but she starts throwing a fit right away. After reading various parenting advices, I thought I'd try this strategy of not giving in while she's throwing a fit. I set her into her high chair, which is a fight, and put her food on it. Instead of eating it, she's smacking it around, so I remove her from her high chair. Just then, I get a call from a doctor to schedule an appointment, so I set Noumena down in her crib and take the call. Noumena is freaking out in her crib and proceeds to do so the entire time I'm on the phone---about 10 minutes.

I wait another 5 and Noumena has calmed down a little bit, but once I get in there she gets animated again. I try to take her back out to get food and she eats a little and is calm in my arms when I feed her, but when I try to set her into the high chair, she starts throwing another tantrum. It's not as bad as the last, thankfully. I set food out on her tray and after less than a minute, she picks it up and starts eating it. This is good, but every time I look at her, she starts crying again. Contrary to what all the parenting advice says, it seems like when I praise her for eating and not throwing a fit, she gets upset with me and just wants me to go back to ignoring her. What the hell are you supposed to do then? Is not ignoring them the new ignoring them?

All the advice you read makes you think that your child is seeking attention and that it's not good to give in when they're throwing a tantrum because they learn through your actions that if they just throw a fit hard enough you'll break down. Certainly, I think this might apply in many cases, but I wonder how selective you have to be in applying it. Sure, as a rule of thumb, it may work, but as a parent you're tasked with taking care of your child. That /means/ giving them /attention/. That means feeding them and bathing them and playing with them etc, so it can't be as cut and dry as they make it seem. Indeed, if an adult had the cognitive capacity of a child---incapable of expressing themselves with language---it would seem like a horrible thing to do to a person to just act like a robot to them. No, I think I'm going to go with whatever my gut says is right from now on even though it was my gut that led me to looking to answer in the first place. This means if Noumena is upset and there's nothing I can do about it due to the circumstances, I'm going to just be present with her until it passes showing her I won't abandon her no matter how hard she has it, but nevertheless, she doesn't always get her way.

Once I take her out of her high chair, she seems to want to make a fuss again. But once I wipe her down and Chalmers starts eating the food we wiped off, I can get her distracted and we read her books together. She goes right for the bird book and right away says "Owl" which is super exciting.

* Playing Outside

At about 7pm, Chalmers has to go outside. I had forgotten to let him out earlier, so I take him out to put him on his leash and I see our neighbor's grandson, Jeremiah, who's the same age as Noumena playing basketball in the street with some friends of my neighbors. I right away want to go out there and play with them, so I put on her shoes and take her outside. They play taking turns handing the ball to one another and chasing each other every which way.

Once we get inside, it's already 8pm, so we just hangout and listen to music, wrestle on the bed and run around a little until bed time.

* Bath/Bed Time


We got distracted playing around so I gave her a bath a little later than usual. I'm going to start trying to make sure she drinks a lot before bath because she's been using her toys to scoop up bathwater and drink it, which is so yucky. Somehow, I forgot to brush Noumena's teeth after her bath and didn't remember until she was already asleep. After having done it maybe 100 times, I cant' believe I didn't remember. Oh well.

Falling asleep took a bit longer than usual tonight, but she was asleep after the second song we listen to. I listen to the third song while cradling her in my arms and lay her down in her crib. She fusses a little when I lay her down, but in a few seconds she's already calm and asleep.

I'll see you tomorrow, Noumena. I hope I can handle your tantrums better. I'll keep getting better every day, okay? I promise, baby. I love you. Good night.

* Morning

I slept really horribly last night, going to bed at 1am and waking up at 4am falling back asleep at 6:30am. Noumena was gracious enough to sleep until 8am, but she sits in her room not fussing totally calm until about 8:30am so that gave me a little while to rest. When Noumena awakes, I take her with me to let Chalmers and Kisa out and we heat up the last of her porridge. I take the laundry out of the dryer and start folding it and Noumena comes around to help make a mess out of things, so I don't end up finishing folding it, just putting away a few items of clothing.

I'm extremely tired, so we head to CVS to get some red bull. Instead of going straight home, we head to that park right after CVS. As is typical for Noumena gaining her independence these last few days, she kicks and screams all the way there. What she wants is to be set on the ground and left to her own devices. She doesn't want her hand to be held. She doesn't want to be carried. She doesn't want to ride on my shoulders. She wants entirely to do her own thing. Unfortunately I can't allow that because we're walking down streets, so I just have to hold her despite all her efforts to the contrary.

* Park

I want to say it's about 9:30am when we get to the park and there are 2 sisters there and their parents. What's funny is I set Noumena down just as we arrive, but since the context has changed, /i.e./ she sees strangers, she starts whining at me to pick her back up!!! All that time she wanted down to do her own thing, now she needs Daddy to hold her. I'm rolling my eyes as I write this. After a while, she lets me set her down, but she's gripping my finger with her hands. It's extremely cute that she doesn't want to let me go. Eventually she understands that it's safe so she goes to play with the others.

There's something about the slides today because Noumena rockets down them. I don't want her climbing back up the slides because periodically the other kids want to go down, so I just redirect her back onto the steps to climb back up to the slides. The other kids have bubble wands and at some point let Noumena use it. It's funny that Noumena understands what to do right away because she ends up using the want to make bubbles immediately.

We stay until 10am and then head back home. At 10:30am, we head out to go meet mom at the library for story time. Noumena kicks and screams the entire way back home. Not sure why walking around the neighborhood is causing this tantrums, but it discourages me from taking her to the park and I don't want that at all. I want her to go to the park all the time because she loves it there, but I certainly don't want to endure tantrums the whole time. Maybe I'll have to put her into a stroller to go there from now on. We'll see how she responds to that.

* Story Time

It's miss Alana at story time today and we learn the sign for "I love you." It looks like the metal devil horns, except the thumb is also extended. I really want to remember this one and use it frequently. It's a good and quick/easy way to teach Noumena that I love her using that sign. We make hearts, and sing and dance and Noumena does a pretty good job paying attention, although she does like spinning in the chair quite a bit.

* Nap Time

It's about 12pm when we head back on. On the ride back, Noumena falls asleep almost immediately. I think it's going to be hard to get her to take a nap once we get home because often when she wakes up from even a short nap she has a lot of energy. This isn't the case today, however, and when I get home I take her right to her crib and rock her back to sleep. I finish folding the laundry from earlier and put another load in, get some dishes done and then I also take a nap.

* Hanging at Home

Noumena did not get the best lunch today. I'm a little worried about it because even though it was mostly fruits and vegetables, it still seems like a lot of sugar. I am completely out of groceries, so I have to go to the store today. Her lunch was 2 purees and a few dates. This is definitely not ideal, but at least it has a lot of fiber and vitamins and minerals.

Noumena is very preoccupied with the books we got out and I end up reading a lot of them to her, but they're keeping her attention very well. I use this opportunity to tidy up the house. I put in another load of laundry since my bed sheets needed to be clean and fold the ones that were in the dryer. Lots of laundry today. I also clean a few more dishes since Noumena is so well distracted.

Eventually 5:30pm comes around and it's dinner time. I don't have anything else like I said, so pasta will have to do again today. Thankfully Noumena didn't give me a super hard time today when I was cleaning her up. I always use baby wipes to wipe up her tray to her highchair as well as her face and hands. Since I know Noumena loves to throw stuff away so much, I throw these baby wipes on the floor and let her pick them up.

We hang out until 6:30pm and then head to Walmart to get some grocery shopping done. We end up in the Walmart parking lot at about 6:45pm and Noumena has fallen asleep. Since she just fell asleep moments ago, I don't have the heart to wake her up. I allow her to nap until 7pm before we head into the store.

* Grocery Shopping

Once we're in the store, I put her in the cart and for a few moments she's fine. But then out of nowhere she starts throwing a fit. I think it's probably because she needed to sleep more or maybe she just wanted down. In any case, I start ignoring her tantrum and she calms down very quickly. We snake through the produce isle picking up lots of fruit and veggies before making out way to the back of the store where they're out of soy milk. I need soy milk. I can't go without it. I always buy it at Walmart because it's only $3 at Walmart whereas $5 everywhere else. We needed pet food and diapers as well so I pick those up, some coffee and we get out of there. She's pleasant the rest of the time we're at the store.

It's hard to believe, but it took me almost an hour and 20 minutes to shop and drive home. That's right it's already 8:20pm which means Noumena's bath time is soon. I have to unload the groceries from the car still, so I come up with a plan to keep Noumena occupied while I unload and the my surprise it works spectacularly! I take her to her room, bring Chalmers in there, set her down and close the door. I figure with Chalmers in there, she's going to be happy. I wasn't wrong.

* Bath/Bed Time

I don't have time to put the groceries away, so I just lay them on the counter. It's time for Noumena's bath. In fact, we're about 5 minutes late today. While bathing her, I realize I have to try to manipulate her into doing what I want. She wasn't as easy as yesterday where she automatically would start putting the letters on the wall. No. I first put the letters in front of her face at which point she tries to bite them, but I take them away before she gets the chance causing her to want to chase them down. Finally, I get her all shampooed down so I can clean her off. She does something new this evening. She picks up the shampoo bottle and moves it to the other side of the tub setting it up right. She does this a few times. It's very cute that she's starting to learn the purposes of things.


I'm so happy holding Noumena as she falls asleep. She doesn't go to sleep right away and I'm fine with it. I enjoyed so much holding her tight while we listened to /Isn't She Lovely/ tonight---more than usual. We listen to /Stand By Me/ and /Just The Two Of Us/ and by the time /Just The Two Of Us/ ends, she's completely out. I lay her down to get a good nights rest.

I love you so much Noumena! I'm excited to hang out with you all day tomorrow. I did a lot of shopping and house keeping today, so it will be a lighter load tomorrow giving me more opportunity to pay good attention to you! See you in the morning my beautiful baby girl!

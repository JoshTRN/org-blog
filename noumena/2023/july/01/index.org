* Spoiling?

I saw a video today where a father is filming his 16 year old daughter and he seems to be really annoying her. He's filming her at the refrigerator saying that she only comes out of her room to eat and that in she's turning 17 soon so that means 18 is a little more than a year away and that she'll have to start paying rent then. I don't know anything about this family's dynamic except what I saw in this video, so maybe this father and daughter have a wonderful relationship and that was all sarcasm, jokes and fun that both parties were comfortable with. Nevertheless, it left a bad taste in my mouth.

If I heard or read this somewhere, I can't remember where, but I don't feel like I'm pulling the sentiment out of thin air that picking up your toddler when all they want is your attention is going to spoil them. If I only learned of this sentiment through watching the interactions of others and never suffered that criticism myself---even if child rearing experts say that it's not the best thing to do, I couldn't disagree more wholeheartedly. Obviously, there are sometimes when it's important not to capitulate. If you're, say, cooking or in the middle of something else important, it should go without saying that you shouldn't drop everything to hold your toddler, but absent these considerations... just think about the 16 year old girl I mentioned earlier.

At one point, she was a toddler and probably only wanted her daddy's attention. The fact that these moments are fleeting occurs to me every single day. I cherish every little bit of attention I can give to my little one because I know that for what ever reason, these moments will not last. I don't know how close fathers can be with their teenage daughters. My assumption is that a relationship can be cultivated wherein fathers are very close to their teenage daughters, although I'm sure that's difficult to do. Regardless, daughter's move away, start families of their own and have other priorities. Inevitably, the day will come where they no longer need you the way a toddler needs you.

For that reason, I pick her up.

* Morning Routine

It's the usual 7:30am wakeup today, but Noumena not making a bunch of noise, so I close my eyes and get maybe another ten minutes of shuteye before she starts making a ruckus. When I head into her room, she's flung her blanket out of the crib and has her right knee stuck through the bars of her crib. She's clearly scared. It's one of those things where it's much easier to get your knee through the bars one way, but not back due to the shape of the knee. I pull on the bars a little bit and shove her knee though. I know what it's like to be in positions like that---feeling stuck---especially as a child, and I always hated it.

We eat porridge and before I change her, after she's full, I think this oversized pajamas are just so cute I have to let her walk around in them.

Before we head out, Noumena helps me with the Laundry.

* Story Time

We're headed to the library today for story time and unfortunately Mom has to work, so we're going it on our own today. Having woken up so early, I want to go to the early story time that starts at 10:15. Even though it only takes about 10 minutes to get to the main library from where we live, I always leave 30 minutes before just because I hate being late to things and that should be enough time to account for anything that might get in the way like traffic. Since we get there early and because it's so early in the morning parking is so easy, we have some time before story time starts. Noumena and I head right across the street to James Weldon Johnson Park. There were 2 fountains there just a few weeks--at most 2 months--ago which were taken down because they also had confederate monuments and protesters didn't like that. It's a shame about the fountains though, because even without the monuments those were really nice. Noumena and I strolled around for a while before it was time to go to story time.

Today's teacher is Miss Alana. Miss Alana was the very first story time teacher Noumena ever saw at that library when she was just a tiny tiny tiny little thing. We say our usual hello song. We have a new sign language sign today for sharing and our shape of the day is a circle.

After we play in the playroom with a bunch of other kids. One little girl in particular plays with us and the dinosaurs. I didn't catch her name, but she wanted a lot of attention. As we wander around the play room, she's always following us Simba from the Lion King plushie. I give her a little attention, but since my focus is on Noumena, she clearly doesn't feel like it's enough. I felt bad for her and wished I could have brought her more into what I was doing with Noumena.

When Noumena walks out of the play room and picks up a book, I take her to one of the little tables and try to read it to her. The little girl and her mother are leaving as we're reading this book, but the little girl doesn't want to go. Her mother is fawning over Noumena talking about how smart Noumena is, the little girl overhears and says, "I'm smarter than her." Oh my god, my heart sank hearing that jealousy.

* Home again

On the way back home, I'm feeling hungry since I haven't eaten, so I stop by the Burger King drive thru which is on the way home and get an impossible Whopper meal, sharing the fries with Noumena on our ride home trying to keep her awake the whole time. Once home at about 12:15pm, I heat up soup for her and there are still fries left. She eats soup, fries and a date. I bring her into the bedroom just to cool down and get ready for a nap.

Usually, when she takes a nap on the weekend, I'll start writing the journal early, but not today. Today I'm tired too, so I take a nap at the same time. We both fall asleep at about 1pm and Noumena wakes up at about 2:40pm waking me up as well. Shortly after her nap, I had to change her diaper. Some of it leaked out the sides and got onto me while I was holding her... yuck. I had to change her clothes too.

We listen to goofy music together and just hang around the living room. I give her a snack that's prepackaged fruit from Beach Nut. It's this concoction of apple, zucchini, cinnamon and something else. The idea of there pureed zucchini grosses me out. I don't know how they can make that appealing to a baby, but Noumena seems to love it. After playing until about 4:30pm, we head to the park.

* Park Time

There's no one at the park today. Usually there are at least one or two stragglers, but the entire time at the park we had it to ourselves. We didn't go down the slide much today, only once. we also didn't do a whole lot of wandering. Instead, rather unusually, Noumena was fascinated with the steps of the playground equipment. In fact, she's been fascinated with sitting a lot recently as we've seen. She spends time going up and down these steps over and over periodically sitting on them. It was very easy going at the park today.

* Evening

We get back home around 5:30pm and I know there's only 1 bowl of that soup left for her, so I decide to go ahead and give that to her to finish it out. It seems like such a healthy meal and so simple to make that I decide to make it again after she finishes. We hang out in the living room for a while before I clean up the dishes and start cooking.

* Night

After cooking, since I threw the potatoes right into the water cold, I knew they were going to have to simmer for a while before that soup was ready, so we decide to head back to the park at around 7:30pm. When we get there, we see Caleb and Mia. Mia's father is there as well. I'd never met him before, so we get acquainted and we play with out kids together.

It's 8:00pm when we get back and I want to taste test the soup, so I try some with Noumena. Basically having guessed at the steps to make it, I think it turned out really well. Noumena eats a small bowl of that. It's really hot despite putting in the freezer to cool it down before she eats. She's so impatient though, I try feeding her. Sometimes it's a little too hot, so she's upset and crying, but then also upset that she can't eat it fast enough. It's a lose-lose situation until the soup cools down. It does eventually though, and she's happy when it's all done.

Given the hot soup made her spit some of it out, she made a mess of her clothes. Normally I wait until 8:30pm to take off her clothes, the same time I put her in the bath, but I wanted to put these clothes into my dirty laundry basket, so I let her wander around in just her diaper before bath time.

I spent all day with Noumena, literally every waking moment, and time just flew by so fast. It was already 8:30pm and time for our bed time routine. Thankfully, Tuesday is a holiday, so I'll get to spend that day with her as well, but it just seemed like today went by so fast. While holding her as we dance, she barely makes it through the first song before falling asleep on Daddy's chest. I dance with her through the other songs anyway because I love holding her so close to me.

Good night, Noumena.

* Late Wake Up

Noumena is trying to do me favors because I didn't sleep that well last night. I coughed so much just before I went to bed I had to use some of the prescription cough medicine from when I was sick before. I'm not sure if it's allergies or something because I haven't had allergies my entire life as far as I can tell, but it made sleep difficult.

She woke up at 8:00am today and her mornings are a lot less whiny than they used to be. I let her whine for a little before I went in there. I tend to make a big entrance when I see her in the morning because I'm excited to see her every day. Today is no different and I go in there making tons of noise telling Noumena how much I love her. As is becoming customary for her, she has thrown her blanket out of her crib. Before taking her out, I pick up the blanket and hand it to her. She drops it again, I hand it to her again, and we do this a few times on repeat before I notice she's smelly. It's a diaper change first thing in the morning. I ask her what she wants to change into and we pick a blue outfit.

Oksana warms us up some porridge and I feed it to Noumena.

* In The Morning Sun

Oksana wants to go to the arboretum again and I think it's a good idea, so we pack up a few things and head out. I know that Noumena's going to want to walk all over the bridges--they're her favorite thing---so we head straight for the biggest ones to walk across.

We follow the trails to go exploring and end up back where we started. Oksana and I take a minute to rest on the benches and drink some gatorade. Oksana put some in a bottle for Noumena, and Noumena predictably went wild. It was hard to tear that thing away from her. We got her distracted with some puffs and puree, so she was quite manageable.

* Lunch

It's about 10:45 when we get back home, so we play a little while Oksana prepares food. On the menu is shredded carrots and pierogies. Noumena is struggling to get behind eating the carrots, but she does like the pierogies, though she has to adapt to them first. I know she doesn't eat enough, so I offer her a date.

We cleanup and it's about 11:20am and I know that it's just a little too early to put Noumena down for a nap given that she woke up so late, so I head to the park with her. Oksana wants to stay behind because she has some food she wants to prepare, so Noumena and I to go ourselves just the two of us, but before we go, as we're headed out the door, Noumena and Oksana catch each others gazes and start making crinkle faces at each other and I'm lucky enough to get it on camera.

* Park

At the park, I don't intend to stay long, but I wanted to wear her out so she could get a good amount of sleep and I can nap at the same time as her. Since I'm tired, I'm not ecstatic about having to run around. Thankfully, I have to do very little. Noumena wears herself out because she's learned where the slide is in relation to the steps. Since the slide turns towards the steps to go back up to the slide, she goes down maybe seven times all by herself. One of those times, she gets her sandals stuck and lightly topples over hitting her head against the slide. I saw that it wasn't so bad and that she's mostly just startled, so I pick her up, reassure her that she's fine, then set her back down to run up the steps and tumble down again.

* Afternoon

It's about 12:30pm when we arrive back home. Noumena and I nap at the same time and wake up at 2pm. Since the beach was so much fun yesterday, we're going to go again today, but we don't want to go until later since it's always nicer when the sun is not so high in the sky.

Oksana heats up soup for Noumena and I feed that it her. Vitaliy calls as we're getting ready to eat again. He gets on camera with me and I ask him for a tour of his apartment. Since he's on cam, I show  him that Noumena is eating and her entertains her while she eats. Noumena absolutely loves seeing him be a goof ball. Then again, she loves everything. Happiest kid I've ever seen for sure.

After our afternoon meal, we play with toys until about 4:30pm when it's time to head to the beach.

* Beach Day Again
[[file:noumena-looks-up-at-daddy-as-the-waves-roll-in.jpg]]

When we get to the beach, Noumena is so confident right away. Nothing like yesterday, she's ready to go into the water. At first, we left our phones in the car. I didn't think we'd need them since we had so much footage of her playing yesterday, but once we got into the waves and she started her amazingly cute screams of enjoyment, we couldn't resist trying to capture it on camera. Oksana headed back to the car to get the phones so we could film it.

There are a select few moments with Noumena when I'm truly as present as can be---moments where I'm totally enthralled with her. While I fling her amongst the waves, she looks up at me with the most gorgeous smile imaginable. This is one of those moments, I bend down to give her a kiss and the smile never leaves her face. She does this a few times and every time is just as precious as the last. Her squeals of enjoyment are another such moment. Lastly, just before we're about to head out, we go to wade into the water as I hold her tight to wash all the sand off of us. I'm looking at her face as she stares out across the open Atlantic and am utterly mesmerized with her. I feel her happiness radiate into my chest and somehow fall even deeper in love than I was before.

* Evening

Noumena falls asleep in the car just as we're 10 minutes from home when it's a 30 minute drive from the beach. I don't want to have to wake her up. I need diapers, so we stop by CVS on the way back, get a couple snacks and diapers and give noumena about another 10 minutes of rest before having to nudge her awake because we've arrived home.

I feed Noumena almost immediately because I figure she's got to be hungry. We get a big bowl of porridge and she demolishes the whole things. She's acting like she's still hungry, so we go back for seconds. I set her down to play with her and eventually Oksana asks me if I want a salad. Of course I want a salad!  As I'm eating and Noumena is playing she brings us this electronic cube with different buttons and gadgets on each of its faces. First she hands it to Oksana, then she hands it to me.... Then she wants up. I know she's not hungry because she just ate  a lot of porridge, but I let her sit on my lap anyway. Apparently, she doesn't think I'm all that good at feeding myself, because she offers to do it for me---an offer which I'm glad to accept.

* Bed time

Just before bath time and bed time, I'm bemoaning the fact that I have to put her to bed soon. The funny thing is that she's fine. I've become the child and Noumena the adult. I'm saying things like, "I don't want it to be bath time!" and "I don't want to go to work. I just want to play with Noumena all day." Nevertheless, 8:30pm comes around as fate intended and we take a bath and get ready for bed. We listen to /Isn't She Lovely/ and /Stand By Me/ in the living room, but I think the light and activity there is keeping her from bed. I take her into her dark room and we listen to /Just The Two Of Us/ as she falls asleep in my arms.

I tell her that I'll love her forever and kiss her several times before laying her in her crib.

Sweet dreams, my precious baby girl.

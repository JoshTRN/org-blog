* Good Morning, Noumenaaaaa!!!

Noumena is such an incredible sleeper. I wonder if other parents get as lucky as I am with my sleeper. I woke up at 7:30am and Noumena wasn't making any noise at all, so I feel lucky enough to go back to sleep. I sleep, but then sort of just wake up naturally at 7:50am and Noumena still isn't even stirring. I have time to get ready myself, brush my teeth and warm her porridge before I even have to wake her. When I do wake her, she's in a great mood. I love it when she's in a good mood.

We eat porridge, but then I have to use the restroom. Her toys are out from the night before and the particular toy I worry about  is her train. Yesterday she was trying to do acrobatics on it and it has wheels, so I have to put her in her crib. She hates this! She hollers the whole time I'm in the restroom. When I go back into her room to pick her up, however, she's immediately fine. She was just throwing a tantrum. I also feed her a puree packet before we head out. I just have to make sure she's well fed. I get her dressed and we head out to the car.

On our ride there, she reaches her right hand back, and I reach my hand back to caress hers. She lets me do that a while before switching to repeatedly high-fiving me and grabbing my hand so she can hear the funny sounds I make when she tries to bite my fingers. Every grain of joy for her is a mountain of joy for me. I just always want to be close to my daughter and will do anything to keep our bond.

Once we arrive at daycare, I hangout for a few minutes in Noumena's classroom with her friends. While I hold Noumena and her blanket, one girl wants me to read to her but the book is so tattered there's no way, and a little boy is throwing this toy rabbit. I try to get him to toss it to me and I think he does his best but he keeps throwing it above his head. Eventually he tosses it to me.

I set her down and she cries a little. As much as I don't like seeing her cry, It still feels good that she cries because it means she'd rather stay with me. Honestly, Noumena, I'd rather stay with you too. Unfortunately the world just doesn't work out like that.


* Dinner

[[file:eating-fruit-bowl.jpg]]

Mom texts me and wants to meet up for dinner. She initially wants to go to a Mediterranean place, so I load Noumena into the car after daycare and head towards the Mediterranean restaurant. Noumena has horrible luck and falls asleep right as we're arriving. Mom realizes it's closed and calls me just as Noumena falls asleep and tells me. I offer to go to the Thai restaurant and mom agrees. Right as we arrive and I get out of the car, Mom changes her mind because she really doesn't want Thai and asks if we can go do Denny's. I agree, so I woke Noumena up for nothing. Poor Noumena. She stays mad for about a minute, but I put on some calming music and that works. She relaxes the rest of the ride.

Noumena has a smorgasbord at Denny's. They start by bringing her goldfish and she chomps down on those while we wait for our food. Mom is brought a salad and Noumena eats some of Mom's tomatoes and reaches her hand into Mom's blue cheese dressing. Realizing this, Mom puts the dressing on a tomato and offers it to Noumena. When Noumena takes a bite, she makes the cutest face. I tried to capture the moment, but unfortunately, I failed. I got a decent one though. Noumena also eats some mixed fruit consisting of strawberries, cantaloupe, grapes and bananas. On top of that, there's rice and bread and french fries and she even eats some of Mom's chicken fried steak. I love giving Noumena a variety of foods.

After dinner, we hang out in a grassy patch next to the parking lot a little bit and I talk with Mom about Noumena as she runs around. Some guy comes by on a bike and tells us he doesn't mean to be nosy but that there may be needles in the grassy patch, so we immediately grab Noumena and head towards the cars. Mommy says goodbye to Noumena and we head home. In the car, Noumena starts off upset, but I put on calming music again and she's content for the rest of the car ride home.

* Park

Arriving home, it looks like it's about to rain, so without skipping a beat, we head straight for the park. I'm on the phone with friends while we're at the park, so I don't take any videos today.

Of course the first thing she does is start trying to clean the park. After she tidies up, I put her in the swing for a little bit. Then she takes off towards the playground equipment. She climbs up a little bit, but she remembers yesterday and decides she's going to try to climb the bars linked together with chains again. She obviously has very little success without my help, so I end up helping her quite a bit because she'll go down the slide, turn around and go right back to the bar ladder to do it all over again. We repeat this process several times. When we finish up, we take the long way back as the clouds have lifted a bit and it no longer looks like there's a risk of getting rained on.

* Back at Home

Once at home, we only have about a half hour of play time before bath time, but she comes up with the running at Daddy game and I'm totally here for it.
Watching these videos back just fills my heart with joy. Her smile and happiness mean everything to me and what's more is that what makes her happy is playing with Daddy. I honestly would have played this game with her all night. Sadly, I only get to play it with her until 8:30pm when it's bath time.

* Bath time

Recently, I've been filling a wash cloth full of water and dripping it over her head. I mentioned this yesterday, but since she's so receptive to it, I decide to try something different, thanks in small part to Noumena herself. You see, before I get her naked, I start running the bath so that it's full by the time I get her into it. I carry her to the edge of the tub, start the hot water, wait for it to get hot, then turn it down to a warm temperature. But this means that when I put her in, the water is still going. Well, today, she tries to pull the pin on the top of the tub spout and starts the shower a little bit. I put it down, but then I think, "why not?" and pull it back up. The shower starts and Noumena has her first shower. I can't read how she feels about it. She seems so conflicted. I turn the shower head off, bathe her, shampoo her head, and turn the shower head back on to rinse off the shampoo. It's not perfect, but she does get a good amount of shampoo off just by rinsing off under the shower. I think this could make bath time easier.

* Bed time

When it's time to go to sleep, as I'm getting her dressed, I remind her of how Oksana would talk about the fliers landing on her head and she puts her hands on her head. I have to capture this.

She doesn't want to wind down as we listen to music in the living room, so I take her into her dark bedroom and she immediately lays her head on my chest as we listen. A lot of the time, I will think about various things while I'm otherwise engaged. It happens to all of us. We'll think about something we said or some plan we have and so on and so forth as we go about our days. I notice that my thoughts are scattered as I'm putting her to bed and so I stop myself and just rock with her until her white noise maker comes on. I stop thinking and become completely immersed in her. Just feeling the comfort I bring her and the happiness she brings me as she sleeps with her head against my chest.

I already miss you, Noumena. See you tomorrow.

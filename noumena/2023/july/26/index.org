* Morning

Noumena slept /great/ last night. I woke up a little at 7am, but went back to sleep for another hour and Noumena hadn't made a peep by the time I got up at 8am. I had plenty of time to prepare her breakfast, brush my teeth and let Chalmers out before having to go in to get her ready. After eating porridge, I have to go to the restroom. I didn't have time to set her down and distract her, so I just went anyway. What's funny is she followed me to the door and sat outside of it crying until I came out. She's so precious. I get her dressed right away since we're a little later than usual. She is not feeling it today. She does not like being on the changing table this morning, though she is better than yesterday. We leave straight away after getting her ready.

* Daycare

* Heading Home

Picking Noumena up goes worse than usual today, oddly enough. She sees me as I enter the daycare and comes rushing at me with a toy in hand. I'm so excited to see her, I rush back at her arms outstretched. She was different clothes than I had taken her there with, so I ask one of the workers to bring the clothes to me. As she fetches them, Noumena starts wiggling around in my arms. She wants to be down and playing with her friends. Even though she can't stand being dropped off, apparently she's not even ready to leave! Next time this happens, I'm going to walk away and see how she reacts.

We leave when the worker returns with Noumena's clothing, but as we exit the building, Noumena already wants to be on the ground. She's flailing her arms and legs, but we have to go home. She resists as I put her in the car seat. I have no idea what's going on with this kid. It must just be the independence. She cries a lot on the way home, but as we get really close to home begins falling asleep. I wake her up right as we get home, and she wants to be on the ground again, so I hold her hand and walk with her to the house and she takes every step along the way including the step up in the entryway of the home. She's so competent now it's truly a sight to behold.

Since she walked in, she's not as clingy as usual. Her toys are nestled across the wall next to the front door, so they're the closest things to her as we enter. She begins shifting through her toy crate immediately. This gives me time to prepare some food for her.

After we eat, we hang out in the living room for a bit.

* Park

[[file:touching-tree.jpg]]

After some time playing at about 6:30pm, I decide to take her to a park that's a little further away to give her more novel experiences and avoid the mosquitoes since there are so many next to our house. I think I'll try a different park tomorrow.

When I go to put Noumena in the car seat, she can't stand it. She's fighting back hard. I know that if she just understood that I was taking her to a park to  have lots of fun, she wouldn't be so difficult. She cries almost the whole way there until falling asleep. Poor kiddo must be really tired. I feel bad for waking her up since she had just fallen asleep, but I know she's going to have fun. When I remove her from the car seat, usually she'll just wake right up, but not this time. While I carry her to the park from the parking space, she tries falling back asleep on Daddy's shoulder. Even as we enter the park and she awakens a little, she doesn't want to be set down right away. Instead we make our way to the play ground  and play mostly on the equipment.

There are these really steep slides on the lowest large platform of the playground equipment. It's maybe 3-4 feet off the ground, so not a huge fall, but at some point while I'm sitting next to the slides, Noumena, the daredevil that she is goes flying over the slide. Luckily Daddy is there to catch her /by her shirt/ before she falls!

Right after I catch Noumena, her mother does a video call with Noumena while she holds my phone and carries it around with her at the park.

Knowing I have no water and there's a corner store very close by,  we walk there Noumena atop my shoulders as we walk. When we get there, I choose a large water bottle and give her some right away. While approaching the counter, I see that they refuse card purchases under $2, so I have to get something else. I look down the isles and settle on bugles thinking I can share them with Noumena. While still in the store, I crack open the bottle and give Noumena some water.

We make our way back to the car and I sit in the back seat with her on my lap before strapping her in so I can fill her sippy cup. I want her to be able to drink at her convenience in the back seat. I fill the cup and we take off.

* Back Home

When we get home, the first thing that I do is sit down with her on the floor to eat the bugles I'd purchased. Chalmers sits next to us, and with Noumena on my lap, we both feed him the occasional bugle. I remembered that I had to take Noumena's trash out, so I head in there and replace the trash bag. While I'm in there, Noumena arrives shortly after. I think she's always curious what I'm up to if she doesn't see me.  I take her trash out with me to the larger trash can to remove both and I hear the door close. Noumena has shut herself into the bedroom, which is perfect! Now I don't have to worry about dealing with her when I take out the trash.

Once I get back into the house, Noumena is eerily quiet. I go into her room to see what she's up to and she's strewn baby wipes all over the place! Thankfully, she ends up helping me put them all back away.

After that fiasco, we end up on the bed. At some point old mid 2000's pop punk starts playing in my head so we listen to that together on the bed, jumping around wrestling and cuddling until it's time to give her a bath.

* Bath Time

It's so interesting watching memories develop. Knowing that she's retaining new things because she repeats experiences from the past. Almost instantaneously as I drop her into the bath with her toys, she heads to the letters, begins picking them up, traversing back to the other side of the bath and sticking them to the wall. I obviously have to film this.

* Bed Time

After bathing, feeding the pets, and brushing Noumena's teeth, it's a littler later than usual. She's been /really/ tired ever since she got home, so we only get through /Isn't She Lovely/ and she's already in a deep sleep. I kiss her a few times in y arms before  laying her in her crib for a good night's sleep.

I love you more than you could ever know, Noumena. Good night, my sweet darling. I already miss you!

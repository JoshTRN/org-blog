* Morning

I woke up again at 7am and hear nothing from Noumena's room, so I go back to sleep. My alarm sounds at 7:30am; I silence it and go back to sleep. Finally, I awake at 7:55am and Noumena still hasn't so much as made a sound. I brush my teeth and get ready and make Noumena's porridge. Sometimes Noumena is completely uninterpretable. While eating porridge, occasionally, she'll jut her legs and begin to whine for no obvious reason as if she got some bad food or something. I'm excited for when she gets language if only so these little bouts are easier to assess. It must be frustrating not knowing why things aren't working out the way you expect. Oh, the toddler's plight.

Just as she's finishing breakfast I have to go the restroom, so I set Noumena down to play with toys to distract her before I go.

I get her dressed and we head off to daycare.

* Dinner

Noumena's mother needed her car dropped off at the mechanic, and she asked me to help so I took her to the mechanic just before I have to pick Noumena up from daycare. Noumena is excited to see her mother and I take them both to dinner at a Thai restaurant. I order fried tofu for Noumena and share my mixed vegetables with her.

* Park

There is a park nearby with geese, so we go to watch them. This doesn't turn out to be the greatest idea. There are geese droppings covering every inch of that park. We still want her to get a look at the geese so we try to find a clean spot to set her down.

Since she can't reasonably spend a whole lot of time at this part of the park, we head across the street to the playground area. The playground is for much larger children, but that doesn't stop us from trying to get Noumena to play around with all the equipment.

After we finish playing, I take Mom to her home and Noumena and I head to ours. She's completely tuckered and unfortunately for her falls asleep on the way home. I say unfortunately because I can't allow her to sleep. It's about 7:30pm when we get back so only an hour before bath time which means I have to keep her awake.

* Back at home

Noumena is understandably fussy when we get back home. I tried reading to her and playing with toys but it didn't really help. I can't remember what calmed her down, but eventually she did. We listen to music together and I start feeling concerned that maybe she didn't eat enough at dinner; she did get it all over the floor after all. I heat up a little porridge and feed it to her just to make sure she's okay. We spend some time wrestling and rolling around on the bed, but she's still quite fussy. I distract her periodically with Chalmers, and Noumena gets on and off of the bed chasing Chalmers around.

* Bath/Bed time

We follow our usual bath/bed time routine. I keep Noumena in my arms for 2 more songs even though she falls asleep right after /Isn't She Lovely/ kissing her periodically as she lays in my arms.


Good night, sweet baby. I'll see you in the morning.

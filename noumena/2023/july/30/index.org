I decided to try to keep the animals out of the bedroom last night because I was worried that I'm allergic to something they bring in with them. I also turned off the ceiling fan. I slept better than I've slept in a long time. I'm going to do it again tonight and see if things keep getting better. If they do, I'll start letting the pets back in to see if things change.

* Early Morning

I say early, but Noumena didn't start making noises until 8:00am. That's longer than she usually sleeps. The noises aren't even of discontent. I rest my eyes and I don't hear her again until 8:30am. I make myself coffee, and get Noumena's porridge ready. I can't remember the noises I made when I came in her room, but what I saw was one of the funniest things. Usually she smiles and laughs when I enter if she's awake, but this time she had a look of horror on her face as though I had caught her doing something. She was in the corner of her crib farthest from the door next to the changing tables and had pulled down the blanket that lays on the changing table as well as the pad that's there for her comfort.  I don't know how she would know because she's never been in trouble before, but she was definitely acting as though she just got caught doing something wrong. Once she realized that I was happy, however, of course a smile came over her face.

I feed her porridge and we end up listening to music all morning.

* Late Morning

Today is just all day playing in between chores for me. It's so much fun. I'm glad I got these little books because she's absolutely enthralled with them. The book with birds has an owl in it too, so she gets to say it a bunch.

* Lunch

It gets to be close to noon and I know Noumena has to eat before she takes a nap. I don't have any lunch type foods prepared already and I don't just want to feed her more porridge since she had that this morning, so I try to figure out what to feed her. I decide that I'm going to heat up the rest of the pierogies and serve her that for lunch.

Noumena always wants to be around me, especially if I'm in the kitchen. While I'm cooking---cutting up onions---she's in the cupboard near my legs and just all around giving me a hard time. I decide to try the trick from yesterday which was putting Chalmers in her room with her while I finish up. Thankfully, I finish up rather quickly, because she is not having it. She doesn't throw a fit the entire time she's trapped in her room, but she definitely cries for a long time.

We eat together and afterward I lay Noumena down for a nap giving me time to prepare soup for the weak and get caught up on a little reading.

* Early Dinner

I had just finished preparing the soup right as Noumena was awakening from her nap, so I let it simmer while we hung out in the living room together. Because she's so distracted playing with her books, after about an hour I put the soup into meal prep containers. I have just enough to fill 3 containers with a little left over. I put that leftover into a bowl for Noumena and put that bowl in the freezer to cool down. I forget about it for a little while and just play with Noumena. It's about 5pm when I pull it out and it's just warm enough to serve. I sit with her and eat soup.

I've been hesitant to take Noumena to the park because I don't appreciate the recent tantrums while trying to hold her and walk at the same time. Nevertheless, I do want to take her. I decide to take her to the park that's a car ride away which makes her easier to manage than carrying her through the neighborhood. Before we head out the door, I put some laundry in to wash that she's going to need for daycare tomorrow planning on putting it in the dryer when we get home. Then we leave.

* Park

It was sort of fortuitous with the weather that I had been hesitating to take her out all day. When we arrive, it's overcast so not nearly as hot as if the sun were out. Noumena doesn't want to get down from me holding her right away, but once I take her to the playground equipment, she's off on her own. To my surprise, she heads to the spiral slide and goes down all by herself! It's very exciting!

Just as she takes the slide for the final time, it starts to rain. With perfect timing, we get to the car just as it starts to rain really heavily and both of us only get a little wet. I had an umbrella in the car, so when we arrive at home and it's still pouring, I can keep us dry for the most part.

* Back at Home

[[file:sitting-on-the-dryer.jpg]]

It's about 7pm once we're back home, and luckily I remember right away that the laundry needs to go into the dryer. So, I enlist Noumena's help as a supervisor to watch over me from atop the drying machine to make sure I don't make any mistakes while loading it. She seemingly approves of my methods, so I take her off and we head inside the house.

Unfortunately, one of the videos got deleted or corrupted or something because I lost it, but we took out the blocks in Noumena's room and she was doing the most daredevil stunts climbing up the stairs and moving them at a greater distance from the rest of the blocks and just all around acting crazy.

We have lots of play before bath time and I want to make sure she's not going to go to bed hungry since she had such an early dinner. I giver her puree and a date and then take her to take her bath.

* Bed time

After bath and brushing her teeth it's still raining. Since we went to bath a little early, we have some time to kill before we turn on /Isn't She Lovely/ so I enlist her help to clean her bedroom and the living room and she obliges. We stand at the door for a while because Kisa isn't coming in for food. I stand at the door yelling her name but she's just not coming in. I guess it's just raining too hard for her to come out of whatever spot she's hiding in.

I take Noumena to her room and we listen to /Isn't She Lovely/ and Noumena falls asleep on my chest. When /Just The Two Of Us/ comes on, I gently rotate her on her back and cradle her in my arms... She stays like this until /Stand By Me/ is over and I shower her with kisses during that song a little bit extra today.

Noumena, your progress is making me so excited! I love watching you move and change and grow. I hope you get a sense of how I feel when you read these back. Sleep tight, sweet heart. I miss you already, as always.

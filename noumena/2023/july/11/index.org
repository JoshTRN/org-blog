There's a saying, "you never know the last time you're going to hold your kid" that I've been thinking about a lot recently. I think about it almost every time I hold her. I think about this journal and I wonder if I will know after the fact the last time I hold Noumena. Will I have the last time I ever have Noumena in my arms documented? Either way it goes, I don't know how to feel about that. If I do have it documented, will it be a sad moment like a loss? Will it be a happy moment like a milestone---a graduation---a movement onto bigger, better things? What if I don't have it documented? Will it be even sadder? That there will be a last time brings tears to my eyes.

I guess for accuracy's sake, the saying should be updated to  "you never know ahead of time the last time you're going to hold your kid or you're how you're going to feel about it if/when you do."

* Morning

Sadly, today is Oksana's last day. I don't know if knowing that Oksana was leaving contributed to our early rise, but both Oksana and I got out of bed at about 7:00am. I woke up at 6:00pm and stayed in bed until about 7:00pm just trying to go back to sleep. Oksana said she slept poorly too. Since I didn't sleep well, I go to the corner store quickly for an energy drink while I still can before Noumena is bound to wake up and eat a bagel for breakfast. Surprisingly, however, Noumena isn't making a peep at 7:30am at all. When 8:00am rolls around, I think I hear a single sound come out of Noumena's room, so I prepare her porridge. When I go into Noumena's room, she immediately gets up at begins throwing her blanket out of her crib. She was already awake before I entered, but she wasn't whining at all. She was just in her crib relaxing. What was she thinking about?

We eat porridge and Oksana sits with us before she has to go. I tried to keep Noumena inside of her pajamas so I could just change her diaper when I changed her into her clothes for the day, but she toddled around for a while and didn't go, so I just changed her into her clothes for the day. Right as Oksana is leaving, Noumena goes to the bathroom. I guess that was her way of saying she didn't want Oksana to go. We walk with Oksana to her car and give her hugs and kisses to take with her on her way home.

We play in the living room for a little while and then head to daycare.

* Daycare

The only photos I got from her daycare today was her eating with her friends, which admittedly is a very cute picture seeing all those toddlers gathered around the table together.

* Ride Home

When I pick Noumena up from daycare, the children are not all in the first room you see as you enter the doors to the daycare, but in the second. As such, Noumena doesn't seem me coming until I'm close to her. When she sees me she lets out a yelping scream and jumps up, runs to her blanket in the best approximation of a run a 14 month old can have, and comes over to me. Seeing her excited like that melts my heart every time.

She hates the car ride home. I'm not sure exactly when this started, but I think recently in the evening the car ride home has been difficult for her. Noumena is almost always fine on the car ride to the daycare, but not home. I wonder if it's because she hasn't eaten in almost 3 hours according to the app. In any case, she's having a hard time in the back seat so I feel bad for her. Nothing I do seems to help, so she's just gotta tough it out until we get home.

* Dinner time

At home, obviously the first thing to do is get my baby fed. I hold her in my arms as I reheat the ragout in the microwave. Once it's ready, I set her in her high chair, mix up the food to make sure it's not too hot and serve it to her. While she is eating, I butter some bread to share with Noumena and plate some vinaigrette for myself. I end up giving her some vinaigrette just to see if she'll like it if she experiments with it. She eats the whole bowl of food which to be honest seemed like enough for an adult. I'm really proud of my growing girl. After clean up, I give her a date and let her wonder around choosing to play with whatever toy she desires.

We have to wait until after 7pm for the pest control guy to get here, so we don't go to the park right away and instead just hang out in the living room. I'm not sure how I got laying on the floor, but when I do, Noumena comes up between my legs to start attacking me.

The pest control guy doesn't show up at 7pm and I wait until about 7:10pm and think if he's that late, then I should just take her, so we head to the park.

I wish I had been filming before, but Noumena was going really fast up the steps and then down the slide. She's so close to mastering it and it's super exciting. Unfortunately, this time her speed got the best of her and she ended up taking a tumble and hitting her chin on one of the playground steps.

I comfort her after she falls, but it doesn't take long until she's raring to go again. Regrettably, however, she steps in what I suppose is dog poop, so I clean off her shoes to the best of my ability, but we have to go home now. We leave at about 7:30pm. Still, this doesn't stop me from taking the long way home even though I have to deal with the bad smell.


* Night

Once we arrive, I take off her shoes and throw them in the washing machine along with my shirt since her shoes would periodically press against it as her legs were draped across my shoulders as we walked home. When I set her down, she follows Daddy into the bedroom. It's then I get the bright idea to put my shirt on her which is just as hilarious as it seems.

She's thirsty from the park, so I warm some soy milk and give it to her. I am trying to get her used to using a cup all by herself, and maybe there's an argument to be made that I should have only tried with water, but the thing is that it's easier to get her to drink soy milk because it's tasty and also, the mess is a bit more fun.

After I clean up the mess, I want to prove that the page with the teddy bear is her favorite page as if yesterdays video wasn't confirmation enough, so I start filming her turning the pages as I say the words on the pages aloud. Eventually, she just decides to use me as a stepping stool to get onto the couch.

* Bed time

We follow our usual bed time routine, but after bath time, it's harder without Oksana. When I would change Noumena into her pajamas and Oksana was here, Oksana would talk and sing to Noumena and Noumena would stick her fingers out pointing towards Oksana and Oksana would kiss Noumena's hands. Instead, I tried to sing and make the same noises as Oksana, but it just wasn't the same. Noumena misses Oksana. So we video call Oksana just to say goodnight.

When I sway with her until she falls to sleep tonight, it's the hardest I think I've ever seen her sleep. I held her for about ten minutes while her head laid against my chest and when I laid her into her crib, she was like a rag doll... completely out cold.

I know you're going to have a peaceful night tonight, Noumena. Sweet Dreams! I'll see you in the morning!

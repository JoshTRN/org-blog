* Morning

Noumena slept until 8am this morning. She hadn't even fully awoken when I went in get her which gave me time to prepare her porridge and brush my teeth before I went in to see her. When I get in the room, she stands up immediately and throws her blanket out of her crib. I reach down and hand it to her just so she can throw it out again. I guess this is a new game. It's cute, so I'm happy with it. We follow our usual tradition of saying good morning to the Easter bunny who is on the wall next to her window and the owls on the wall opposite the Easter bunny.

I feed Noumena porridge and close to the end she already wants down. It's funny though, because she's conflicted about it. She wiggles in my arms to get down, but once I let her down she starts whining to be back in Daddy's arms or on Daddy's lap. She calms fairly quickly, however, as she runs up to Chalmers to give him affection. I leave her in her pajamas thinking that she'll soil her diaper since she just ate, but she ends up not doing so this morning. I dress her in her purple outfit and away to daycare with her sheet and blanket we go!


* Daycare

At daycare, they take a couple pictures of her just before heading down the slide. I'm sure she was brave enough to go it all alone even though Daddy wasn't there to keep her safe.

* Dinner

Oksana made a dish called Ragout that I had for lunch today and there was some leftover. It had a pretty mild flavor, so I thought Noumena would like it. When we get home, Oksana heats it up while I goof around with Noumena and Chalmers. Happily enough, Noumena loves the Ragout immediately. She eats the first bowl no problem and prompts me to go back and give her more. We add a little bit of bread to the Ragout and she eats /everything/. She eats so much that this turns out to be her final meal of the day.

I can't resist clowning around while she eats.

* Hanging at Home

I read to Noumena a lot today because she's obsessed with her first words book. She has a few favorite pages, but none as favorite as the one with the pink teddy bear on it. The order of her favorites goes:

1. Pink Teddy Bear (Teddy)
2. Orange Tabby Cat (Cat)
3. Dalmation (Dog)

As you can see in this video:

After reading and playing around with toys we decide to head to the park. Before we head out though, I stop in my office and Noumena comes with and we end up playing instruments together.

* Park

[[file:walking-to-the-park.jpg]]

Noumena, once again, is preoccupied with cleaning the park after we go down the slide once. I thought for sure since yesterday she'd want to go down the slide a bunch, but I guess that's just not her style. She has to clean the park. Every time we go, she leaves it cleaner than when we arrived. She's so little and I'm already so proud of her.

At some point, friends arrive and when they do she becomes more interested in swinging. When we first got there, I tried to put her in the swing, but she didn't want to at all. But now that another baby is in the swing, she of course wants to swing with her.

We leave shortly after swinging and take the long way home.

* Night

We arrive at about 7:45pm and once again it just feels like there aren't enough hours in a day for me to spend with my littler girl. We listen to music and dance just before bath and bed time.

Every day is an adventure with Noumena even if we do the same things. It makes you realize that every day is special and always has been but you take it for granted. When you're taking care of someone you love so much who depends on you so greatly, you want to stretch your moments out for eternity. Noumena is so easy going and beautiful and I want to maintain her affectionate and loving demeanor for as long as I can.

Noumena, thank you for being my reason to get out of bed in the morning and brightening every day with your presence alone. I'll see you in the morning sweet pea! Goodnight!

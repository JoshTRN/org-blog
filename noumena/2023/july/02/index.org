* Morning

Noumena actually slept in this morning. My goodness I feel so lucky. I woke up at 8am and actually before she did. I kept resting my eyes until she started making noises. It wasn't long before she was up. Maybe you won't believe me when I say this, but I didn't actually smell anything when I picked Noumena up out of the crib this morning. I just had an instinct to change her right away which is unusual. Normally she waits until after breakfast to poo, but not this morning. Her diaper was full right when she woke up.

We had more porridge for breakfast this morning. I had been wondering why most people don't write songs in 7/8 that sound like this, so I picked the baby up and did it with her.

She was super independent pretty much all day except when she needed a boost.

* Arboretum

Since she didn't get a chance to see Noumena yesterday, Mom wanted to visit with Noumena. We went to the Jacksonville arboretum. Unfortunately, we didn't grab many photos. Noumena found a slope she really like and went up and down over and over again. It's so cute how she likes stuff like that. It's good. She gets plenty of exercise.

Afterward, Mom wanted to pick up some things from the house, so Noumena and I went out for a car ride while mom was at home. I wanted to take her to this island that's about 30 minutes away, but she fell asleep almost immediately upon starting our drive. We drove all the way there, but there was a ton of traffic due to 4th of July weekend. Once we got there, since I didn't want to disturb her nap, we turned around and went right back home. She took a nap in the car today.

* Home

For some reason today I was really tired even though I had gotten plenty of sleep. We ate a bunch of soup and these fruit packets from Beach Nut that also have vegetables in them. Noumena pretty much spent most of the time playing with her toys completely independently, it was really impressive how focused she can be now.

I wasn't sure if I could put her back down for another nap, but I really needed sleep. I started rocking her at about 4:55pm and she fell asleep by 5pm. I set my alarm for 6pm, and took a nap at the same time. When we wake up, I realize we didn't get to hang out at the park today as much as I wanted so we head there.

* Park

Today, Noumena got to spend so much time at the park. There were three other kids there, not our usual friends, but they brought stuffed animals with them!!! I wouldn't let Noumena played with the stuffed animals until I had gotten permission from the children they belonged to, but once they gave her permission she was ecstatic. You'll see the ecstasy come through in these videos. While those kids run around the park, Noumena loves participating so much. She wasn't as actively close to them as perhaps she wanted to be, but she was definitely playing with them in spirit. They made her go crazy and it was crazy adorable and absolutely beautiful.

When we go to leave, the little girl she had been playing with is currently swinging on the swing. I tell her we're going bye-bye and tell Noumena to wave bye to her. The little girl yells, "wait! I have to give her a kiss." This is the most adorable thing in the world.

* Night before bed

Before heading home from the park we stop by the store to pick up some tea because I really had a craving for tea.

Noumena is really starting to demand attention and it's the cutest thing in the world. I thought I had occupied her with toys and that it would give the opportunity to do some dishes, but once I started doing them, she came up, started pushing me away from the sink and demanded I pick her up. With such a cute display how could I resist?

I pick her up and we dance until bath time.

Instead of falling asleep on my chest in the living room as usual, this time she falls asleep in my arms as I rock her to sleep. Honestly, I like this way of putting her to bed because I get in lots of kisses as she's falling asleep.

Good night, Noumena!

* Morning

Noumena has gotten a lot better at just relaxing in her room in the morning when she wakes up without having to wake daddy up. I woke up at 7am, but laid in bed until 7:30am. I didn't shower last night and Noumena wasn't fussing, so I took a quick shower and then get her porridge prepared. When I come into her room, she's already awake. She awoke a long time ago, maybe around 7:30 or a little later, but she didn't make any noises and just laid there content. She's growing and maturing---learning she's safe in her room alone.

After eating, we hang out in the living room for a while. I don't want to take her to daycare, so I stall until about 8:45am.

* Daycare

Arriving at her daycare at just about 9am, I take her in and see her friends sitting in a circle with one of the teachers. I plop down and sit with her while the teacher sings and claps and I participate. Noumena is happy because she's on my lap. She's not quite reached the point where she's just comfortable with me leaving, but she is very comfortable in the daycare as long as I'm there with her. I sit with her for about 5 minutes before setting her down and she starts crying right away. It's still so heart-warming that she cries just because she wants to be with me. If I could, I would spend all day with her and she'd never have to cry because I wouldn't hold her. Sadly, I have to work.

* After Daycare

I wish I had gotten a picture from when I picked her up from daycare. She apparently had diarrhea, which I think was probably just a loose stool, but she got her white skirt dirty (of course). It seems as though the only spare clothes the daycare had left was these pants that had the feet on them. These were tucked into her sandals and was just ridiculously funny looking. She had this cute top on with these sweatpants/socks combo and sandals over it. It was so amazingly funny.

As we're driving, she falls asleep pretty quickly. They didn't track her nap today---I wonder if she simply didn't. I find that unlikely, but still, she fell asleep on the car ride home. She was making discontented noises before she fell asleep, and so I reached my hand back there and caressed her face. I looked in the rear-view mirror as I caressed her face and saw her eyes closing as I traced my fingers lightly across her face. I knew she'd be out soon.

She doesn't get to sleep long. I debated trying to put her to bed once we got home, but when I pulled her out of her car seat, she was just way too awake for that. Instead, I fed her soup and all banana puree---which she ate all of despite the fact that she wouldn't eat only banana yesterday---and we hung out for a little while in the living room before heading to the park.

* Park

There's this pose she does where she's standing on her feet and her head is on the ground and she's looking between her legs. Every single time she does this I try to capture this because it's the cutest thing ever, but I'm never quick enough on the draw. Today I just ended up taking a picture of her butt.

We hang out for a little while at the park, but not long because the mosquitoes are going absolutely nuts today. They, along with the heat, are the worst I've seen them since moving here. it was extremely bad.

We take the long way home and I notice Noumena, perched on my shoulders, is licking the sweat off my head. Naturally, I take a video of it. What else was I supposed to do?

* Home Before Bed

I give her some soymilk after we get home because I imagine she's parched. After she drinks, I set her down and go to charge my phone. She seems content just playing with toys so I take a little break and lay on the bed. Of course she comes running in shortly after, so I get up and start running around with her. Eventually, I remember I have grapes and I don't want to forget to eat them so I put them in a bowl. Noumena comes to help out, of course and we eat grapes together with her feeding me and Chalmers.

* Bed time

[[file:in-daddys-arms.jpg]]

As I put Noumena to sleep, holding her in my arms, I see her beautiful face dimly lit in the darkness of her room. The camera can't capture the exact quality, but I want to share this beauty and I want to treasure it forever.

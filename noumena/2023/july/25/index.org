* Morning

I think Noumena began to stir at 7:30am this morning, but she wasn't making a whole lot of noise, so I rest my eyes and go back to sleep. To my surprise, she sits in her crib absolutely fine until 8am when I reawaken. When I awake, I can tell she's awake but she's still calm, so I head to the kitchen and prepare her breakfast.

I have to use the restroom just as she's done eating breakfast. I don't want to hear her scream, but I don't have time to set her down in a way where she won't feel separation anxiety, so I take her with me to the toilet and sit her on my lap while I use it. At this point, she wants to move around, so I set her down. She plays peek-a-boo with the shower curtain which is really cute, and then, thankfully, leaves the restroom and me in peace.

She's much less fussy this morning than a couple days ago which is how she usually is while I get her dressed. One thing is certain, if she's hungry, she's hangry and she'll let you know it too. I get her in a cute outfit and we head to daycare.

* Dinner

Noumena is always very clingy right when we get home from daycare and who can blame her? At the same time, she's hungry, so it's a mad dash to try to get her fed. I usually have food prepared, but I don't want to give her porridge again and I don't have anything else prepared, so I have to make pasta. Given that she's clingy, I keep her attached to my hip the whole time I prepare the food.

Our food is finished at around 6pm. I gave her a ton of pasta to eat as well as butter and bread. We eat together, but I finish a little bit before her so it gives me time to do dishes while she finishes up.

I had a stack of papers that was basically just junk mail. She loves papers, so after dinner I let her tear into it. She leaves paper strewn across the whole of the house. We hangout for about 45 minutes but I'm on the phone with my dad for a good amount of time, so I'm just passively watching her destroy the living room. At about 7:00pm we head to the park.

* Park
[[file:standing-in-the-park.jpg]]

There are three other kids at the park when we arrive. I think they're all brothers, but they're teenagers. One of them wasn't, his name is Brian. Noumena knows him well, but he was almost entirely focused on his older brothers, so they weren't much fun for Noumena to play with. Still, Noumena spent a great deal of time just observing them. There was a lot of wrestling going on and a lot of running, and kicking a soccer ball, so plenty for Noumena to pay attention to. I'd say she spent a good ten minutes just passively observing the other kids play.

To my surprise, there was very little trash removal today. She did go down the slide quite a lot though---definitely more than usual. By about 7:45 I though for sure she was getting worn out. I missed a few photo opportunities, although I tried to catch them, but at one point she was sprawled across the playgrounds steps and I thought she was definitely tired. Naturally, I think since she's practically trying to lay down, it's time to  go home---Noumena doesn't like this.

I've definitely reached the independence-craving toddler phase---at least to some extent. She doesn't want to be carried in my arms. She doesn't want to be carried on my shoulders. She doesn't want to be led by the hand. She wants to wander entirely freely. The problem is we're on the street, so it's got to be one of those unwanted options since she won't follow. Every time I pick her up she whines and wiggles, kicks and flails. She definitely didn't want to go home. I try leading her by the hand, but then she collapses her legs, so I'm forced to pick her up. I just can't win with this baby right now, so I opt to carry her the whole way---kicking and screaming as they say.

* Back Home

Once home, she becomes docile very quickly. I think maybe it had to do with Chalmers. Once she sees him, she's very quick to calm down. I give her a date to preoccupy her as well as a couple cups of soymilk since I know she's got to be thirsty from the park. We sit together and stack rings on a peg, I read her a book and we wander around the house together before bath time.


* Bath And Bed

Bath time is the same as usual except recently I've found a new trick. See, what I used to do is shampoo her hair and scrub her body while she still had shampoo in her hair. What I realized was that it's always easier to rinse her hair immediately after shampooing it. That way, I have more time to get her into an optimal position to rinse her off whereas before, I would have wait to start draining the tub until I had rinsed the shampoo off. Her body is much easier to rinse than her head, so I can just unplug the drain
while rinsing her body off. It's a lot easier.

My friend Chris calls me as she's in the bath tub, so I talk with him while she bathes and continue after she's out. I forgot to do her laundry so I have to put on these pajamas that she definitely likes less than the others because the legs have to button up as opposed to zip up. I'm talking to Chris the whole time, but after we brush her teeth and feed the pets, I get off the phone to lull her to sleep.


She's asleep by the middle of /Isn't She Lovely/, but we listen to /Just The Two Of Us/ before I lay her into her crib for sleep.

I love you, Noumena. As much as you're a pain trying to gain your independence slowly and incrementally, I'm still proud of you and your development.

See you tomorrow, my beautiful, wonderful, amazing, precious little girl.

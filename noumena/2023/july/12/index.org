* Morning

It's a 7:30am wakeup call courtesy of Noumena. I got plenty of sleep, so I pick her straight up out of bed. We eat porridge and head out to daycare a little after 8am.

* Evening

When I pick Noumena up from daycare today, I came with a secret weapon. I thought that maybe the reason for her frustration yesterday was that she was hungry---after all, the last time she eats is about 3 hours before I pick her up---so I brought dates with me so she could munch on them on the car ride home. They take a while for her to eat, so she only gets through 2 of them by the time we get home. It definitely made a difference from yesterday, although she was still a little fussy.

When we arrive home, Noumena doesn't seem like she's too discontent. I warm soup and feed her, and she's basically fine. Afterward, she's incredibly fussy, though. I'm not sure why. I thought feeding her would take care of any frustrations she may have had. I try to play with her with some toys, but all she wants to do is read her book. I do that a couple of times, but she's latched onto Daddy and even though I calm her down a little bit, she's still dissatisfied. I'm not sure what's going on, but she can't really be calmed down effectively, so I lay her in her crib thinking she must be tired. She falls asleep within 2 minutes at about 6:15pm.

"Okay, that has to be what was bothering her," I think to myself. I take a nap in tandem with her setting my alarm for 7pm thinking I'm not going to allow her to sleep longer than that. She awakens at 6:50pm however obviating that concern and instilling another one. Having only slept for only half an hour, I'm thinking she may still be cranky. Sure enough, she still is. I think she may just miss Oksana. I put her shoes on and we head out the door. I'm thinking some fresh air might make things better.

I need to get trash bags for her room for diapers, so before we head to the park, we head to the grocery store that's just a couple of blocks away, pick up our things and head straight to the park.

* Park

Literally right as Noumena and I arrive at the park, she sees a styrofoam plate on the ground. She starts struggling to get out of my arms, so I set her down. She immediately picks it up and heads to the trash can.

After cleaning up, she sets her sights on the slide.

It takes her a long time to tire of the slide and I tell her she can do it as long as she wants. Eventually, she wants to move onto bigger and better things. She tries climbing the bars linked together by chains that lead up to the slide and I'm so impressed to see her push her limits.

I help her climb the bars and it's very hit and miss. Sometimes she gets her foot on one and sometimes she grips one, but 50% of the time she doesn't. She uses this climbing opportunity to go down the big slide multiple times. She finds a stick on her way up one of the times and we play catch with it.

* Night

It's about 8:10pm when Noumena and I arrive back at home and at first, I'm having a hard time getting her to play independently. What gets her playing after a while though is me chasing after Chalmers with her toy shopping cart. After she sees me playing with him, she wants to join in and she starts by lifting it up!

She's acting like an insane daredevil with this toy train and is driving me nuts. She tries standing on it and it has wheels. I'm raising Evel Knievel. After some time she gets a hold of her blankey, starts making noises and I take that as a perfect opportunity to shower her with kisses.

* Bed time routine

I shower Noumena with affection until it's time for bath. During Bath time, I've started squeezing the wash cloth after it's wet and slowly dripping the water over her. She is never surprised by it and seems to like it, but it's a good strategy for me to get her hair wet. She's also picked up this peculiar behavior of treating some of her bath toys as if they were shoes. I can do nothing but smile and admire her as she tries to adorn her feet with bath toys.

After bath, I bundle her up, brush her teeth, we feed the pets and dance until she falls asleep in my arms.

I hope tomorrow is easier for you Noumena. I love you so much.

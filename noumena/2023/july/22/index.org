* Morning

This morning, Noumena wakes up super early at 7am.  I would have given her time in her crib to fall back asleep, but I wanted to check on her since she had those diaper blowouts the past couple days. When I get into her room, she's in wonderful mood and no blowout today. I get her dressed right away and feed her porridge. We hangout in the living room until a little after 8am when I go to CVS to get red bull because I felt so tired.

Noumena's growing up and she no longer wants to be carried around on Daddy's shoulders. She's comfortable being carried in my arms, though, so that's still nice.

 I felt hungry when we get to CVS so I buy some barbeque chips and we eat them together

We play and read and by 9:50am, she's already tired. We listen to music together and then when she goes down for a nap, I take a nap too even though it wasn't all that easy because I had drank 2 red bulls.

I wake Noumena up just as it's time for us to go to the library to meet up with Mom. I want to make sure she's not too hungry, so I make some coffee---yes more caffeine---and feed Noumena a pear puree. It's about quarter til 10am when we leave.


* Library

We get to the library just in time for story time and I get a few moments of Noumena playing with mom and seating inappropriately on her chair.

* Lunch/Nap time

I'm not sure what to feed her for lunch, but we have porridge left over, so I feed her that. At close to 1pm, I lay her down for a nap. I nap for about 30 minutes and can't sleep longer, but Noumena sleeps for about 2 hours.

* Home

We hang out at home for about an hour and a half but then I want to go to the store to make sure I get stuff for dinner and stuff to prepare tomorrow.

* Store

There's a European store about 16 minutes away called Romashka that Oksana told me about and I want to buy pierogies, so I pack Noumena into the car, turn on the music and we head there. They have much better braid than any traditional American grocery store, so we get bread as well as dates and the pierogies.

After the European store, we head to Walmart. I'm going to prepare a veggie soup so I get ingredients for that, as well as salad, porridge and a ton of fruit for Noumena and me to snack on.

* Dinner

Noumena had a lot of independence today while I prepared dinner. It's been a long time since I had pasta and I really wanted it so I made bow ties and butter some of that delicious bread for Noumena and I to have for dinner. I set Noumena in her high chair and I'm very proud of her with the way she's been eating. She barely makes any mess at all and eats all the bow ties and bread that I give her making it very easy for daddy to clean up after her.

* Back Home

It rains a lot after dinner so we just hangout around the house, end up wrestling on the bed a lot.

I try to go outside a couple times, but it keeps raining. It doesn't stop until about 8pm and I still want to go outside, so I perch Noumena atop my shoulders and head out.

* Walk

We get a couple blocks away before Noumena starts whining and wiggling around on my shoulders demanding to get down. I have to carry her in my arms a good amount, but eventually she even wants down from there. I have no choice but to let her walk along side me... we walk maybe 5 blocks together all the way back and it's amazing. I'm so proud of my big girl.

* Bath Time

Mom calls Noumena on video just before bath time. She can really tell she's talking to her mom on the phone she's learning so well.

* Bed Time

I didn't clean up the living room well before getting ready, so when I take her out there to listen to music, she's trying to reach stuff I had left out on the table. I decide to take her to her room. Once she's in the dark, she lays her head against my chest and falls asleep almost immediately. This is my favorite tradition. After /Isn't She Lovely/ finishes, I rock her in my arms to /Stand By Me/ and /Just The Two Of Us/ before laying her down to bed. She's completely exhausted and I'm not surprised. She's been up for at least 6 hours and she had probably the longest walk she's ever had on her own two legs not to mention all the playing and wrestling we did. I lay her down into her crib and like a rock, she doesn't move at all. She's totally out.

I had so much fun with you today, Noumena. Weekends are definitely my favorite. It's just a shame I was so tired. I'm extremely tired as I write this right now! Hopefully I get really good sleep tonight so I can have even more fun with you tomorrow!

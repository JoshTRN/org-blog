* Early to Rise...

I woke up at 6am this morning. No real explanation why, but I tried going back to sleep with very minimal success. Noumena also woke up earlier than usual at 7am. She wasn't stirring too much, but I could hear her in there talking and making noises. I didn't get out of bed until 7:30am when Noumena started ramping up her complaining. I've noticed that she doesn't start getting upset until she throws her blanket out of her crib and can't get out to get it.

* Breakfast

Yesterday, I ran out of the porridge and I didn't take the time to make more, so today we had to have oatmeal. Oh no... I also ran out of soymilk. That's "okay" (big quotes) because that baby oatmeal is instant and you can serve with just water. But there's no sugar in it, so it's really, really bland. I thought about adding maple syrup to make it more appealing for Noumena, but she seemed to devour it quickly, so I wasn't worried about it.



* During the day

Having a holiday where I just get to hangout with Noumena all day is fantastic. It's so wonderful not working and just spending all my day with her.

Early in the morning around 8:30am,  I went to CVS since I was so tired from waking up so early to get a red bull. Everyone who works at CVS knows me and Noumena since I go there so often and they, like everyone else, are all infatuated with her. How could you not be?

It's already super hot, so I decided to take her to the park because I didn't think we'd be spending too much time outside. Today, it got to 94°, but the weather app said it felt like 104° probably because of the crazy humidity. We unfortunately don't get to spend much time there because Noumena has a dirty diaper shortly after getting there so we have to leave early.

We spend a lot of time in the living room today, but also lots of time in her room. At some point, I put her on the bed with me and we're hanging out until she passes out. It's early though, about 10:50am, so I'm happy that I'm going to be able to get her to take another nap later on tonight.

* Afternoon

For lunch, I fed her the rest of that soup. She's so in love with that soup though, I have to make some more. I also need soymilk, so we decide to walk to the grocery store. I had all the ingredients besides the head of broccoli I needed for that soup, so since I knew I wasn't going to need much, despite the heat, I plopped her atop my shoulders and we walked to the grocery story that's right down the street from us. I picked up soymilk, broccoli, more oatmeal for Noumena, and a few of these fruit/vegetable packets because they're good snacks. I forget that I'm about to run out of dates, so we don't get those, but she also loves them so I'll have to remember to get more. We also get some apples to make more porridge...

After, just as I had predicted, Noumena falls asleep /again/. This is good. It gives me some time to clean up around the house.

She's busy enough with her toys and everything else that I have plenty of time to make the soup. I cut up all the veggies first, saute the carrots and onion, then the noodles and throw in the water and the rest of the veggies to cook. It's a super simple meal but I think it's relatively healthy and it's really easy to get Noumena to eat it. After it's done cooking, we have that for dinner.

* Park


I wonder how long it's going to be the case that Noumena's primary interest at the park is cleaning up all the waste. It seems like no matter when we go, the first things she starts getting into is picking up the trash, taking it to the trash can and throwing it away. After she's finally done cleaning, I take her down the slide once, but discover crazy behavior that she likes, so I end up going down the slide while she waits at the bottom to get her several times. I must have done it 10-15 times and I'm thoroughly tired after all is said and done.

* Home

Noumena ate so much today, I don't feed her for the rest of the night. In between meals, she had 3 of those fruit/vegetable puree's, several dates, some crackers and a pickle. We spend the rest of the night goofing off until around 7:30pm when I go to take her for another walk.

* Bed/Bath time

Bath time comes so fast and I enjoyed so much of my day with Noumena I don't want it to end. It's sad that I have to work tomorrow and I have to take her to daycare.

Noumena, as you rest peacefully in your bed and I document our wonderful day together, I stand her missing you. I always want to be here for you and I want to be a better man to be a good role model for you. It's hard for me to go it alone, but I can and I'm strong and I'll continue to get better as time moves on. I promise you, baby girl, I will be the best daddy I can possibly be and I'll do everything in the world to take good care of you.

Good night, sweet heart. I miss you already.

* Morning

I woke up so early today. It was 4:30am for me. I have no idea why I woke up so early, but it was really hard to get back to sleep. I laid awake in bed until I'd estimate about 6am. Noumena woke up at 7:30 as she usually does.

For the past couple days, I've made overnight oats for us and we have been eating together. It's super simple to make. We listen to some music and read a book this morning then head out to daycare.


* Return from daycare

Oksana arrives to come help out while Noumena is at daycare, so I have a surprise for Noumena when she gets out.

When we get home, the first thing, as usual, is to eat food. I have soup left over that Noumena will never get board with. Oksana made me a salad, so while the soup is reheating in the microwave, I give Noumena salad. I put everything on her tray, cucumber, lettuce, onion, tomato... She didn't eat any of it. Once the soup is ready, we eat together and I finish first, so I have some time to wash dishes while she finishes up her food.

She was a bit fussy in the car and she woke up at 2pm when I checked the daycare app, so we thought she would need a nap. After eating, I take her into her room, turn on her white noise machine, rock her a little bit and she goes to sleep at about 6:00pm. We wake her up around 6:45pm and head to the park.

* Park

Our friends Yaya and Ja were at the park today and Yaya is a huge fan of Noumena so we spend a good amount of time playing together.

At some point, chasing becomes the thing to do so Yaya and I end up chasing each other with Noumena in tow both ways.

* Living Room

The rest of the evening is spent in the living room after we get back. I ate some not very tasty canned peaches and tried to give Noumena some, but she agreed that they weren't very tasty so she didn't eat any. I gave her a fruit pouch instead.

* Bed time routine

8:30pm comes so soon because we're having so much fun. I just never have enough time with this girl. Oksana gets some awesome bath time photos and films us while we dance with our nightly routine.

Sweet dreams, Noumena! I had lots of fun with you today.

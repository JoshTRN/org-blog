* On The Road Again

When I go to pick Noumena up from the daycare, she's excited to see me, but she starts running away immediately. I'm not sure why, but I think she wants me to chase her. She's starts in the front room, but then runs all the way to her classroom which is in the back. I follow her all the way there.

Noumena has had a strange self-defeating behavior when we've been traveling in the car that's started a couple days ago. I usually put her in the car seat with her favorite pink blanket, but I'm actually considering stopping this practice. She's been throwing it out of her car seat and then yelling about it. Obviously, I'm driving so I can't continually reach back there and give it back to her, so she often just yells.

* A Difficult Evening

Noumena's daycare usually tracks her naps, but today they didn't. I'm not sure if they just forgot or for some reason Noumena just didn't take a nap, which I think is unlikely.

When we get home, because Noumena's fussy, the first thing to do is have dinner. Since we have soup left over it's very easy. It's congealed again, so I let her eat while I do the dishes. I cut up an apple thinking she'll eat it with me, but all she wants to do is play with it, so I don't allow her to and I just eat the apple myself. This upsets her. She just wanted to play with the apple. What's the big deal?

After eating, we go to the bedroom and just hangout on the bed together with Chalmers. She brought one of those rods that goes to her wooden box. This ends up giving her a really hard time. She puts it in her mouth, then falls onto the bed I assume really hurting her mouth. She begins to scream.

I try to console her, but nothing is really helping. I take her outside to go for a walk, but we start getting rained on so we have to head back. It's about 6:30pm and she's still frustrated. I think it's gotta be because she's tired, so I rock her to fall asleep in my arms. She falls asleep quickly.

The rain has graduated to a thunderstorm by 7:00pm and it's really loud. She gets started awake by the sound of thunder and the wind and rain beating against the house. Because she slept at most 30 minutes, she's upset right when she wakes up. I tried to give her a fruit packet, but she resists. Nothing will console her, so I turn on the TV. There's a show on there I used to watch when I was a kid called The Big Comfy Couch. Watching that calms her down enough to eat the fruit packet. I also gave her a bagel to much on. Eventually she feels good enough to wander independently but it was oh so hard.

* Just before bed

Just before bed, I decide to take Noumena for a walk. The storm had cleared up and I get stir crazy, so I'm excited to go outside even for a short while. I've been inside all day after all. We take a short walk because it's 8pm and that means her bath time is in 30 minutes. We walk for about 20 minutes and she starts being a goofball on my shoulders on the way back home.

You'd think that with all the time I spend with Noumena, I'd want a break. I suppose to some extent that's true, but I only usually want a break from her when I have to do tasks like cooking to take care of her that don't involve my immediate attention with her. Other than that, I don't care for breaks at all. I love taking care of Noumena. It's why I get out of bed in the morning. Because of this, these 3 hours after work that I get to spend time with her are just not enough. Think about that. I have the weekends with her, but 3 hours a day is just 15 hours a week. If you count about 12 hours each weekend day, you get 24 hours on the weekend and 15 during the day so 39 hours with your kids if you're lucky and have a job like mine which is pretty solidly 9-5. The day care spends 40 hours with her. They spend more time with my kid than I do.

What a world we live in. I don't need a break from her, I need more time with her.


Once we get out of the bath, I use Oksana's technique to distract her. She's gotten so smart she puts her hands on her head herself now! It's great to see.

Noumena has had a difficult evening and unfortunately things are about to get a little worse. She has a small pimple on her forehead---I'm not sure how she got it---but I'm caressing her face as I put her to sleep and reflexively, when I touch this pimple, I think it's a piece of crusted food or whatever else toddlers get on their foreheads. This is a really stupid thing to think because she had just taken a bath. Anyway, I go to scratch it off and remember this is just as she's falling asleep. She starts screaming and I feel so guilty and horrible.

I eventually end up consoling her and she falls asleep in my arms.

I'm sorry, Noumena. I hope you have a better day tomorrow.

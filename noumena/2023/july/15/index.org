* Saturday!!!

Noumena woke up at 7:30am like clockwork, but I just couldn't get out of bed. I laid there for about 5 minutes then got up to use the restroom before going to pull her from her crib. It turned out that was just enough time for her to go back to sleep giving me another 30 minutes to rest. I really needed it today. Just before she gets up a second time at about 8:05am I make her a bowl of porridge.

We're going to leave for story time at about 10:30 so we have time to hang out together, so we listen to Nuryl and hang out until about 10am. I want to take a little walk so we head out before it's time to leave. I don't intend to change her outfit before we leave, but I do want to make sure she's fed. I give her puree, but she ends up spitting it all over her shirt, so I change her clothes and we head out to the library.

* Story time

We meet Mom for story time, learn a new sign language sign for family and our letter of the day is the letter "F".  Of course we stay to listen to Misses owl and go to the courtyard to hang out with Mommy.

Noumena, never ceasing to amaze me, decides she can drink from an open top bottle all by herself making leaps and bounds.

* After story time

There's a park right across the street from the main library. Someone is playing live music over at the park. I always want Noumena to have as many experiences as she can so I want to go check out the music. When we get there, we realize it's Jesus weirdos, but I still want to let her listen to them and talk with the people around there.

Once we get home, I'm trying to set Noumena up for nap time, but I don't want her to sleep on an empty stomach, so I warm her up some soup. Shortly thereafter, I take her into her room and we listen to music and she falls asleep as I rock her without any fuss whatsoever. She naps for 3 whole hours giving me time to take a nap and a nice break!

* Hanging at home

I'm feeling a little lazy after Noumena wakes up from her nap, so we just kind of chill together from about 4:pm to about 5:30pm before I take her to the park.

* Park

We don't stay very long at the park because she goes number 2 in her diaper while we're there, but I am super impressed with her today. She even goes down the large twirly slide at the start all by herself. I help her because she doesn't take the optimal seating position, but I'm still so proud that she got onto it by herself.

* Dinner

Dinner tonight is a black bean soup that Oksana made and Noumena absolutely loves it. I fed her because it was a little past 6:pm and she hadn't eaten anything since I gave her that puree and 5:30-6pm is her usual dinner time.

* Shopping

I had to get ingredients to make Noumena's soup and porridge so we need to head to the store. Noumena is also about to run out of diapers so we head to the grocery store. I get a bit carried away with the veggies and we get a huge grocery haul. I'm talking about all the stuff we're doing the whole time and just giving her constant attention while we're shopping. It's weird because these little moments when I'm just super engaged with her are some of the most memorable, heartfelt and treasured experiences even though it's something as mundane as shopping. I'm constantly kissing her, explaining what fruit and veggies we're getting and why, what it's for, what we're planning, etc.

* Bed, Bath and... that's it... there's no beyond

We see our neighbors who also have a toddler right as we pull up from grocery shopping, so we head over there to say hi, but we can't stay long. When I get into the house, it's already almost bath time, so Noumena and I just carry the groceries in together and just when we get them all in, it's bath time.

She's always talkative after bath time, but this time she has a particular consonant in mind.

She falls asleep halfway through /Isn't She Lovely/ but I hold her and listen to /Stand By Me/ and /Just The Two Of Us/ entirely anyway fully immersing myself into the experience of holding her tightly while she sleeps on my chest.

I took a lot of photos and videos of Noumena today. And reading back over this journal entry just makes me wish it wasn't her bed time---that I could spend more time with her. Noumena's beautiful smile means the world to me---I loved today so much because there wasn't a moment apart from her nap that I was without her. I so look forward to tomorrow as another day I can spend fully with Noumena. I wish I had every day with you, my sweet, sweet, beautiful, precious, lovely, baby girl.

I miss you and it's only been a couple of hours, Noumena. I'll see you in the morning.

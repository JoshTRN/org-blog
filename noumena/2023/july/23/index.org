* Morning

It's another 7am awakening for Noumena, which means it was a 7am awakening for me. I have to be honest, I went to bed early last night and even still 7am feels very early to me. There's no way I'm getting through today without going to get red bull, so Noumena and I warm some porridge up together, I feed her and we hang out for a little while before  I take her to CVS with me.

* Park

It's before 9, so Noumena and I head straight for the park before home. The park is a little wet from last night's rain, but it's not too big of a deal. I have to stop her from trying to play in the water collected at the bottom of the slides in any case.

* Visit From Mommy
Mommy bought a toy from Amazon and had it shipped to us so she calls me and asks if it's okay to come give it to her. I say yes and Mommy stops by and stays for about an hour. Since Noumena is so fond of feeding others, the toy is a doll that has a spoon with retractable peas and a bowl that emulates feeding the doll. It's funny because Noumena tries to eat the peas herself and also tries feeding them to Mommy and Daddy.

When Mom leaves, it's around 12:30pm and time for Noumena's nap. Normally, I will try to prepare food while Noumena sleeps, but today I feel unwell and tired and need to nap as well. Noumena sleeps until about 2:30pm and I slept until about 2pm. A loud thunderstorm starts at about 1:30pm and I worry it's going to wake Noumena but she sleeps through. Chalmers is always afraid of thunderstorms, so I cuddle him on the bed trying to make him feel safe.

* Hanging In The House

Since it rained so much, we're basically stuck in the house. Because of this, I ended up taking a lot of videos of us just playing around. I have to make Noumena porridge for the week, so I do that while she plays in the living room. Periodically, she comes to visit me while I'm cooking so I have to take short breaks to distract her and then come back to cooking. I added banana to the porridge today. I hope she likes it.

* Park II

After a while, since the storm has let up, I decide to take Noumena to the park. We do still end up getting rained on but it's just a little bit. In the video, it's currently raining, but you can't even tell the rain is so light. Noumena taking steps without using her hands seems like another milestone, so I'm totally excited for it.

* Dinner

Since I didn't cook during her nap, I'm not sure what to make for dinner. We had pasta last night, so I don't want that again. I decide to cook those pierogies we bought at the European store yesterday. I have to do the same distraction thing and I also give her a date to tide her over until dinner is ready. I made a lot because I knew that I was going to eat a lot and I wanted to make sure Noumena got a good amount too. I get selfish with the pierogies, so I have to make sure there's extra.

* More Playing At Home

The evening seems to go by so fast when I'm playing with Noumena. We play all the way up until it's time for her to go to bed and it feels like her bed time comes too soon.

* Bath and Bed Time

Today was really rough. I think I may be getting sick again. Noumena has had a runny nose the last couple of days and I woke up with a really mild sour throat and was very low energy today. I don't think I'm getting sick like before though. It seems like my immune system is keeping up with all the viral variation, so I think I'll get over this quick and Noumena seems totally unphased. I can't even tell if she's sick apart from the runny nose which could just be allergies.

We listen to music in her bedroom and as usual she falls asleep on my chest. Since she hadn't taken another nap since her first one, she goes to sleep /really/ quickly. I cradle her in my arms until about 9:05pm when I lay her into her crib. She's totally out and doesn't make a sound when I lay her down. She's definitely going to sleep well tonight.

Good night, Noumena! See you in the morning.

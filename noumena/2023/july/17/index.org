* Good Morning, Noumena!

Noumena is great again today as far as sleeping goes. I woke up at 7am and didn't really go to sleep again after that, but Noumena didn't wake up until I woke her up at 8am. I don't even think  I heard a peep from her until then, but when I went into her room to get her, she was already awake. She was just being quiet like a beautiful little angel.

We eat porridge and I call a tow truck to take care of my car. Since I don't have a ride, Mom offers to come help, and we use her car to drop Noumena off at daycare.

* Picking up Noumena

When I pick up Noumena it's raining pretty heavily. I didn't grab the umbrella, but I did have a towel that was left over from when we intended to go to the beach, so I wrap that over my head and go into the daycare. One of Noumena's teachers had lost one of her shoes a few days ago and said she would get Noumena new ones, so when I get there, I see Noumena wearing a brand new pair of shoes. They're nice and black and white. She gets up and runs towards me and I'm so excited to see her! She's also apparently excited to see me! I pick her up, grab her old shoes, drape the towel over us and we head out to the car. Even though we can't play music, she's super relaxed on the car ride home and I'm grateful for it.

* Home

As we arrive home, Noumena starts screaming almost immediately as we enter the door. Nothing happened to her, so I have no idea what's going on. I assume that she must be hungry. We warm soup in the microwave right away and that seems to be what it is. She's just really hungry. I feed her soup, but she doesn't seem satisfied when it's over, so I also feed her banana, oatmeal, apple puree. Noumena's in a great mood after that. Since it had just been raining, we hang out a little inside the house and just play on the floor together.

* Park

After a while, it looks like it's clear enough to go outside to the park. It's still pretty cloudy, but I don't think it's going to rain anymore. We take the long way to get to the park just in case it starts to rain I want to get some more exercise. Noumena does her usual trash clean up at the park and that's most of her activity. We don't stay too long. I would have let Noumena stay longer, but since it had just rained, the slides were all wet and when she went up to one of the slides, she bent over and tried to start drinking the water, so I stop that right away and it means she must be thirsty so I take her home to get something to drink.


* Cooking

I didn't eat soup with Noumena, so I was hungry. I remembered that I had pierogies in the freezer, so I decide to cook those after I get Noumena some water to drink. For the most part, she's distracted with toys in the living room, so I feel comfortable cooking while she's entertaining herself, but eventually she comes in the kitchen to help out. She doesn't really want to go, so I have to distract her. I'm glad that I discovered that she likes nectarines. I cut up a nectarine, put it in a bowl, and put the bowl in the living room so she eats that away from the kitchen. I do it because I'm paranoid about the baby in the kitchen. Eventually, she finishes that however and I have to finish cooking while she's in my left arm, held as far away as possible from the stove while I stir with my right hand.

* Evening

I cherish some of the smallest and seemingly insignificant moments, but they also remind me that I'm going to lose them. Every once in a while, when I see her run by in an unexpected but entirely cute way from around a corner, it just melts my heart. Something so little as running around a corner is just the most precious thing to me.

Noumena's always so excited to be in my presence too. She's always running up and tugging on my shorts telling me she wants me to pick her up. I give in almost every time. How could I not? I do try to avoid her sometimes though and this happened in a particularly funny way this evening. First I get her distracted in the living room by some toys, then I rush to the other end of the house to the bathroom in my bedroom. I start peeing in the toilet and I here her little pitter-patter. She's closing in. Just as I finish, she runs up to the toilet and goes to reach into it. I jolt my hand down to grab her arm just before she touches the dirty water. She looks up at me, more stunned than anything, stares for a little over a second and begins to cry because I wouldn't let her touch the dirty water.


* Bed time

We follow our usual bath and bedtime routine, but I think she's really tired because she falls asleep halfway /Isn't She Lovely/. We listen to the /Stand By Me/ all the way through in her room, and I'm confident she's out, but when I set her down, she starts wailing. I feel bad, so I pick her up and rock her for another 5 minutes, but when she goes back down, she starts screaming again. I guess she's just going to have a hard time sleeping in the crib tonight, which breaks my heart. She cries for maybe 3 minutes before passing out.

She seems to be having a rough night though, because she wakes up several times making noises. It never lasts long, but every once in a while she lets out a loud scream. I resist the urge to go check on her because I don't want her to have a harder time falling back asleep, but it's really hard not to go in and comfort her. Sometimes she just has a bad night.


I'm sorry tonight's a hard night Noumena. I hope you still get good sleep and I'm wonderfully excited to see you in the morning!

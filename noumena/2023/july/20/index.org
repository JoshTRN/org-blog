* Bad Morning

From my perspective, it seems like a great morning at first. I wake up at around 7:30am and Noumena hasn't made a peep as far as I can tell, so I go back to sleep setting my alarm for 7:50am. My alarm goes off and still no sounds from Noumena. I brush my teeth, get dressed, warm Noumena's porridge and go into her room to get her.

Oh my god! She's awake--totally peaceful--and there's vomit in her crib! There's also a funky smell... this isn't good. I put her on her changing table and go to change her diaper. It's a diaper blowout. It's solid, but there's so much it's coming out of the sides and landing all over the place. I can't believe she was content in these conditions.

Like the last time this happened, she smells atrocious. I'm less worried about getting her into the bath right away like I was last time though. I was so shocked last time I think Noumena could tell so she hated the bath. This time, I was a lot more patient. Although, it was a bit different because she didn't have vomit in her hair or anything. Anyway, I strip her down, change her diaper and we sit down to eat her breakfast---almost naked.

After breakfast, I start the bath, get her naked and clean her up before we leave. Through all of this, she's as happy as can be. I guess I thought it was a bad morning at first, but any morning where she's a happy baby is a good morning to me.


* Daycare

* Home

When I pick Noumena up from daycare and start taking the bridge we get stopped. It's a dead stop and I'm just lucky enough to change my route and use a different bridge. She's falling asleep by the time we get on the second bridge which means she sleeps for about 15 minutes while we drive home. Once we get there, I try moving her in without having her wake up. It seems successful because when I get her to her room, she's still closing her eyes while in my arms, so I think she's going to take a nap and that I'd wake her up at six, but when I lay her into her crib she starts crying. I shut the door and give her 5 minutes to fall asleep, but she stays awake the whole time, so I prepare soup and go to get her fed.

Since what she had thrown up was the same soup, when I try to feed it to her she's not having it. I don't think it was the soup that made her sick though unless she's allergic to some vegetable in it because I had the same soup with no problems. Nevertheless, she will not eat it at all. I don't have anything except porridge I can quickly prepare off hand so I give her a puree. After getting it all over herself, once she finishes the puree we hangout in the living room for a while before we head to the park.

* Park

Noumena and I walk to the park together. I forgot that I wanted to take her to a different park, so I'll have to remember to do that tomorrow. It seems as though all the reasons I had to always go to the park that was close are gone. Her friends used to be there every day and now I never see them. I'm not sure if it has to do with the fact that it's summer break or what, but now that she's not got anyone but Daddy to play with at the park most days, I figure it might be good to just take her to different places.


Once at the park, the first thing I try to get Noumena to do is swing. I'm not sure how it happens, but she seems a little reluctant to put her feet through the holes in the swing, but once she slides in, I think she hit her mouth against the side of the swing. I yank her out and set her on the ground to see if that's the problem. She's not any more satisfied, so I pick her up. While carrying her, I notice a little blood coming from her lip. She had to have hit her mouth against the bucket seat.

I know what will calm her down. I find the nearest piece of trash, hang her over it like a crane, Noumena picks up the garbage, and I transport her to the garbage can. I do this several times moving her from location to location until she's feeling much better.

I'm not sure why, but I haven't been able to get her to go down the slide recently. She got hurt one time, so maybe she's just being cautious until she's more confident she can do it without ever getting hurt. All she does is wander around, which is totally fine, but I think she's still not in the best of moods because of the swing incident. She falls to the ground periodically, looks upset and makes discontented noises.

I think because Noumena sounds like she's not having a great time that she's not really interested in staying there so we take the long route home. This was a huge mistake. She definitely wasn't done wandering, but I didn't know this until I was way too far away from the playground on the other side of our neighborhood. Noumena doesn't want to be on my shoulders and she doesn't want to be held so she just ends up crying and screaming in my arms. She is so mad at daddy. She just wants to be on the ground. I set her down a few times and she starts to wander, but there aren't a lot of sidewalks and when I try to guide her by walking, she whines about that too.

I have to carry her home flailing and screaming. My poor baby.


* Back at home

[[file:not-quite-relaxing-on-the-couch.jpg]]

Noumena is basically fine immediately when we get home at about 7:30pm. I give her a small glass of soymilk and she's fine. I remember that she hasn't eaten though, so I make some porridge for her to eat. She eats the whole bowl. I'm glad she doesn't attribute her stomach bug to the porridge. Hopefully she doesn't hold a grudge against the soup too long. It was her favorite. I think I'll have to substitute it with something else.

After porridge, we spend time wandering around the house, wrestling with her, playing with toys and reading.

* Bath/Bed time

After bath, we brush her teeth and feed the pets as usual. She's really exhausted tonight. She barely makes it through /Isn't She Lovely/ before falling asleep on Daddy's chest. I don't want to let her go. Hell, I don't even want her to go to bed right now, so I hold her for another 15 minutes in my arms and listen to music while holding and caressing her. I already miss her.

Good night, my precious baby. I hope tonight is better than last night. I worry about you kiddo.

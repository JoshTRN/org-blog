* Morning

Except for waking up at 7:00am to use the restroom, I woke up at 7:55am and Noumena wasn't making any sound whatsoever. She gave me plenty of time to brush my teeth and make coffee. I think I heard sounds coming from her room before I prepared her porridge. Right when I enter her room, I'm confronted with a heinous smell. She's had a diaper blowout again. I looked in her crib and didn't see any vomit, so that was good, but her poo has seeped down her left leg in her pajamas. I'm reminded of a video I saw literally just yesterday of a diaper blowout where the baby had it on her stomach. Thankfully Noumena wasn't moving around too much while I was trying to clean her because it took a /long/ time.

I leave everything except her dirty pajamas in her room. I took those to the washing machine even though I ended up getting them out later to clean them a little better by hand before washing them and I washed them multiple times today. The same as yesterday, I prepare her porridge and she ate in her diaper before giving her a bath. Thankfully she's easy to bathe and redress, so that was very good.

I take a bit of time to use the restroom, and when I come out, Noumena has draped my boxers around her neck and is carrying her blanket around and chewing on it. I have to take a video, but we leave shortly thereafter.

* Daycare

When we arrive at daycare, I sit with Noumena and the other kiddos. They other kiddos are so easy to interact with because each one of them is doing something fun and unique. Eventually, I prompt Noumena to stand on her own. When she does, I notice she's not crying. I am overwhelmed with pride. This doesn't last too long, though as when she realizes that I'm really leaving, she does start to cry. She does appear to take it a bit better though.

I've sometimes thought about what milestones she's going to reach and I'm no longer going to feel pride, but sadness... maybe a bit of both, but in these moments, I'm completely overcome with pride. I hope this applies to when she gets older and starts wanting independence. Will I still be proud then? Probably.

* Back Home

Noumena falls asleep in the car on the way back pretty quickly, so I think she'll need a nap when she gets back. I put her into the crib and leave her for a couple minutes, but she's made up her mind. She's staying awake, so I pick her up out of bed.

I set her on the ground with her blanket and she starts demonstrating some... odd behavior.

I feed Noumena and then wanted to take her to a different park, so we head out.

* Park

Arriving at the park, there are 2 clearly malnourished kittens right where we park the car. I take Noumena to the park and resolve to help the kittens when we're done playing.

When leaving, I turn the car on to start the air conditioning, put Noumena in the car seat and pick up the kittens and put them into the car taking them home with me.

Once we get home, I first give Noumena soymilk since she was hot at the park,put her into her crib, grab the cats, put them in the bathroom in my room, and close the doors to both my room and the bathroom so Chalmers can't bother them and give them food and water.

* Playing in the Living Room

It's almost 8pm after all of this and it sucks that we don't get to hang out more. I get carried away playing with Noumena and we end up late to bath time.

* Bath/Bed time

After her bath, as I'm drying her off while she's looking at the mirror she starts making these amazing sounds so I have to get her on camera doing it. All of a sudden she gets shy and doesn't want to do it anymore.

Since it's /so late/ because we took a bath late, I brush her teeth but we don't feed the pets together. I do that after she's in bed. No, instead I take the music into her room and we dance in the dark while she lays against my chest. She falls asleep almost instantly. Of course, I still have to dance with her for two more songs because I want to feel her warmth against my chest.

I'm so excited for the weekend Noumena! We get to hang out all day on Saturday and Sunday!

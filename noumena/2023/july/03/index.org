* Morning

It was 7:30am when Noumena awoke this morning. She woke up feisty right away. Come to think of it, she was feisty all day. We ate the rest of the porridge today, so I'll have to make more. I don't know why, but I wanted to put her in her nice white outfit today. After I dressed her, I let her play in the living room while I went to the restroom. Once I got out, she had gone to the bathroom too and her stool was loose getting all over the white dress. Oh boy... I switch out her clothe and put everything in the wash before we head to day care.

On the ride there, we're stopped at a red light listening to music. I look back at her and she looks at me with a huge smile. She holds my gaze for maybe 30 seconds before turning away. These moments are so precious.


* Back from daycare

Once we get back from day care, I start feeding her that soup. That soup was become mush. All the fluid was absorbed by the noodles and all the fat congealed. This is actually a good thing though, because it stays together really well. It allows me to just spoon it onto her tray and she eats it all by herself, so I don't have to spoon feed her, which is nice.

I'm not sure what inspired this, but I decided to get out her blocks. We play with them for a good long time in her room.

* Park

I'm sad to say that there are no kids at the park today, so we end up just playing by ourselves. The first thing I set my eyes on is the swing, but she's only interested in that for about a minute. As is Noumena's traditional fashion, she's interested in throwing away trash. If this is how she is as a baby, I think I'm going to raise a good kid. A one year old cleaning up a park? Unheard of.

We wonder and play for about 30 minutes and I get her close to running. I'm also regularly trying to get her to jump of ledges and stuff that I know she can take. This all wears her out.

On our way back from the park, I try to keep her awake, but there's really no chance. She's a goner.

* Nap time?

She couldn't stay awake to save her life, so when we get home I let her take a nap for 30 minutes at about 7:15pm. Just at 7:45pm, our babysitter Kay stops by and I wake her up. Noumena is not having it. she starts fussing immediately as I get her out of the crib. The kid just wants to sleep, but if I let her keep going, she'll never go to bed on time, so I have to wake her up.

We visit with Kay for a little while then eat dinner which is more soup and crackers. I also gave her a pickle to see how she would like it. She liked to suck on it, but didn't ever actually eat it.


* Bath Time

I use hand towels to clog the bathtub during bath time. Something Noumena has been doing that I never got the chance to capture until now is that Noumena has started plugging and unplugging the drain. Unfortunately, I can't upload it to Youtube, but trust me when I say it's super cute to see her experiment with it.

* Sleep

I was totally wrong about her nap. I though napping so late would make it very difficult to get her to sleep, but not my baby. I swear she's making it easy on me because she loves me. I rock her in my arms while we listen to our nightly playlist in the dark and she's asleep by the time the second song comes on.

I give her several kisses before resting her into her crib.

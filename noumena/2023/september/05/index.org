My sister once bemoaned the fact that she was too rigid and scheduled when raising her children. She wished she'd foregone some of the routine in favor of cultivating rich experiences with her children. The way she put is that they would forget the spotless house, but would remember the spontaneous rich experiences. Ever since I read that, I took it to heart. I try to exemplify this every day with Noumena, but today felt extra special.

* Morning

This morning, Noumena probably would have continued sleeping until 9am. Unfortunately, gone with the weekend are the days of sleeping in, so I wake her up at 8:30am after having prepared her porridge for the day. As we sit down to eat, she starts fussing. It takes me a little to figure out what the issue is, but I realize the problem is that she wants to feed herself, so I allow her to do just that.

Since Noumena's eating on her own, it takes a little while for her to finish up. She doesn't finish until after 9am. When she does, I get her dressed and we head out.


* Picking Noumena Up From Daycare

When I get to Noumena's daycare, she doesn't see me right away. I see her playing with blocks, so I sit next to her surprising her and I start playing with her. Of course her friends have to photo bomb us.

We play for a few minutes before we head out.

* Arriving Home

When we get home, she's asleep. There was a traffic jam on the bridge, so Noumena passed out as we were traveling. I don't want to wake up, so I just sit in the car with her for another 10 minutes while she sleeps and just watch stuff on my phone letting her nap until 6pm.

As I heat up our dinner, Noumena starts crawling into the kitchen cabinets! At one point she crawls inside it entirely and closes the door! Oh my goodness! If only I had gotten it on video! Unfortunately, I only got something similar... I was just not quick enough.

* Dinner

We're having chili again tonight, but I offered it with green beans. Noumena did end up eating the chili eventually, but she just really loves green beans so those were her focus. I almost ate none and she almost ate the whole can! I will take this into consideration in the future and treat the green beans more like a desert item until she finishes her other food!

After Noumena finishes dinner, I try to get her on video going to get dates out of the pantry since she understands what I'm telling her even if she doesn't say anything.

I wanted to go to a park that was out of the way, so I called my friend Chris to see if he wanted to meet us at Riverside park. He told me that he and his other buddy were going to go on a bike ride and invited me to go along. I agreed and he asked how I would carry Noumena. We still have her body carrier, so I check if it meets the size requirements and it does, so I tell him I can handle it and although having reservations, we drive to meet Chris at his house.

* Riding Bikes

We didn't have a concrete plan where we were riding, so I was just following Chris. Chris and his friend wanted to go see their spouses at a restaurant where they were eating, so we head there. We stop for a brief moment because they were inside and then head off eventually reaching Baker Point Park. Noumena did so well riding, only getting nervous if there were high traffic areas, but we decided to take mostly side streets, so she did really well and had a ton of fun riding in the bike!

Right as we arrive, I hand Noumena to Chris. It's so precious that she remembers him. She has no problems with him holding her. That time we spent with him really did cement him into her memory.

Noumena and I wander right up to the river right after I take her back from Chris. She's having the time of her life and I absolutely love it. I stringently hold her hand the entire time because she's a crazy risk take, but It was so much fun and it was beautiful there. The breeze was wonderful. There was another playground across the street we went to before heading home. The ride back took about 15 minutes and Noumena would periodically stand on the bike frame. Somehow, this made me extremely proud. She just seemed to have such good balance I was so impressed. Really, I think she was just tired of being suspended in the carrier! Either way, I loved it and so did she.

* Driving Home

Before leaving, I want to make sure Noumena's hydrated, so I ask Chris if we can step inside his house to give her some water. After drinking, it's already her bed time so we head out.

I thought Noumena would fall asleep on the way home, but boy was I wrong. Not only did she not fall asleep, she hated the car ride. My only guess as to why it was so difficult for her was that she could feel it was bed time but we hadn't done any of our bed time routine. As I usually do when she's crying in the car set, I reach my hand back to caress her hand and arm gently to make her feel better. It's the only thing that calms her down. When I'm not caressing her, she starts crying immediately. I caress her arm the entire 15 minute drive home.

* Bed Time

When we get home, I forego bath time. It's okay to miss a day every here and there especially when good opportunities arise! The first thing I try to get her to do is brush her teeth and she refuses, so I take her to feed the pets first. Once that's done, she lets me brush her teeth. I take her into her bedroom with her blanket, get her changed into pajamas and we start listening to /Isn't She Lovely/. Surprisingly, she's only in bed 30 minutes later than usual! We get through /Stand By Me/ before I lay her in her crib for a good night's sleep.

Noumena, nothing pleases me more than the opportunity to take you to have good experiences. They're everything to me. I want to ensure you grow to be healthy and measured but always willing to take opportunities life may have in store for you.

I love you so much and I am grateful every day you came into my life. I was truly lost before I knew you, Noumena. I was so lost, I didn't even know it. But then you arrived and changed everything. You carved a path in the darkness I wasn't even aware could exist and I will be grateful to you every second of every day of my life for the opportunity to raise you.

* Morning

No sleeping in this morning. Noumena was awake bright an early. It's kind of hard to believe because you'd think after such a busy day yesterday, she'd need plenty of rest. Not so, apparently. She stirs me from bed and I go to the kitchen to prepare her porridge before we head to the car to head to daycare.

* With Mommy At Park

During the day, Noumena's mommy texted me asking if she could see Noumena at the park after I pick her up from daycare. I agreed to meet her there. After picking up Noumena, we drive only 4 minutes to the park and Mommy is already there waiting. Mommy brought a snack for Noumena so we sit at a bench to eat before going to play. She has peanut butter cheddar cracker sandwiches (a combination I never really understood and never liked even when I was a kid) and an apple juice box.

As Noumena chomps on the crackers, of course crumbs start falling to the ground. Within seconds, ants are already swarming around the crumbs, forming a line working in a team to try and bring them back to the colony. Noumena, Mommy, and I watch on amused.

Once Noumena's done eating, we start walking with her to the playground. She gets distracted by the ledge seemingly trying to go up and down back and forth on it, so her mother assumes she wants to climb. She brings Noumena to the stage where there are stairs. Noumena declines to take the stairs instead opting for the ramp to get up on the stage. While she's up there, Mommy brigs a giant fallen palm tree branch and Noumena begins to run it across the bridge as if she were a janitor.

After a little while, Mommy wants to head out, so Noumena and I pack into the car and head home. I call my friend on the car ride home and Noumena falls asleep. When we get home it's about 6:10pm and Noumena's still asleep, so I figure I'll just talk on the phone until 6:30pm when I gotta wake her up. When I get out of the car, I see Miss Theresa across the street so we opt to go over and hang out for a while.

* Seeing Miss Theresa

After chatting a little while with Miss Theresa, she remembers she has baby sunglasses, so we put them on Noumena. Noumena has a lot of fun with it. Occasionally, Noumena slides down off my lap in between my legs to wander a little not too far. Theresa's husband had been burning incense on their porch table to repel the mosquitoes, but this left ash on the table. On one of her ventures down, Noumena started playing with the ash. Theresa wanted to put a stop to that, so she started hosing down the table. Noumena wanders into the hose and Theresa asks if I want her getting wet. I say sure so Noumena takes a shower!

Theresa asks if I intend to take Noumena to the park today and I said I hadn't fully considered it, but I thought why not. We drop some stuff off at home and then head to the park.

* Park

I'm not sure what's gotten into Noumena, but she barely wants to play at the park. We swing for a little, but she appears to tire of that quickly. When I set her down, she starts heading towards the gate and street. I obviously can't let her go to the street, but she knows I'm going to chase her. I bring her back from the gate probably 5 times trying to distract her with different things around the playground every time, but to no avail. What's fun right now is to do what Daddy doesn't want her to do. Since she doesn't seem to want to play much at the park, we head back home.

* Back at Home

Once there, I prepare a late dinner for us at around 7:45pm-ish. It's been a long time since she hasn't wanted any attention from me whatsoever, but I guess I'll be getting more and more used to the independence as time goes on. I'm allowed to prepare the food uninterrupted as she is busy chasing Chalmers around the house. Once I realize that's what she's doing, I have to stop what I'm doing in order to watch it. It's just too cute.

After Dinner, she saw me using a floss pick, so of course she got jealous and wanted to do it herself. She must have thought I was chewing on something tasty. I figure what could it her to let her have it and she starts flossing her teeth.

I had just cleaned the bed sheets and put them in the dryer before I went to pick Noumena up from daycare, so they were ready. I had Noumena help me make my bed before it was her bath time.

* Bath/Bed Time

Since we went to bath late, I tried to wash her really quickly. I use a purple wash cloth to clog the drain in order to bathe her, but she pulled it out as I was shampooing her. It felt like a race against the clock as I frantically rinsed her hair while still being mindful not to get any shampoo in her eyes. I plugged the drain with her toy hippo to buy me some time as I rushed to also wash her body after her hair was rinsed. All that rushing caught us up on time! Her bath is over at her usual time around 8:49pm, so we brush her teeth and feed the pets and get ready for bed.

Noumena went to bed without issue, but as I was writing this entry, she woke up screaming. This is the second time this has happened. When I enter her room, she's standing in her crib facing the wall. I don't know why she's doing it. Maybe she's afraid. I go into comfort her and lull her back to sleep. Comforting her when she's in a state of distress is one of my favorite things. I'm glad that I'm able to soothe her back to sleep. She sleeps soundly now as I finish today's entry.


I'm sorry you got startled awake, baby girl.

I was thinking about impermanence a lot this evening. I was thinking about what it means and how I can instill knowledge of it into Noumena. I was thinking about my own impermanence and how she's going to handle it. Some day, I will be gone when she's an adult. Will these journal entries persist when I go? I think I might be able to set it up so they do. Still, she will no longer have her daddy. The only remnants will be her memories and what I leave her behind.

I've only ever had to truly grieve the loss of a single loved one in my time. When I learned of my step father's death, it seemed like such an injustice in a way. I was saddened that all that remained is memories. He occurred to me again when Noumena was about 9 months old. Again, I was beset by a sense of injustice. For all his faults, and believe me there were a lot of them, I loved him so much growing up. Danny was amazing with children. I always wanted to be around him and all my friends always wanted to be around him. He was funny, charismatic, energetic, kind and extremely loving and when he wasn't depressed or in pain, those traits covered him like a aura. It's wrong that Noumena will never get the chance to meet him. What can I do with the knowledge of this infringement? I can mourn and be grateful for the opportunity to mourn.

It's cliche that some people want their life to be celebrated in their death, but it's cliche for a reason. There's a kernel of truth in celebrating bereavement whether religious or not. Some part of all of us knows that this moment is all we truly have. As the reader's eyes scan the page, it's true that this moment is all she truly has. The future doesn't exist and neither does the past. They will and have respectively, but they don't currently, at least in some sense---to further invoke cliche,the present is all there is.

So what happens when we grieve? The beloved's existence has permeated through time, beyond their final moments and is with the bereaved now, in the present, at the time of grieving. There's something beautiful about that. And what beauty is had in that moment in all its splendor, just like the beloved, will fade into the next---truly unique and never to resurface in exactly the same way again.

That's what I hope I can show Noumena. I hope I can show that literally every moment is preciously unique. That this exact state will never come again and what that means is that she can appreciate it while it's here and be willing to let go when it's gone. After all, what choice does she have?

* Morning

Surprisingly, I woke up before Noumena today. Usually she's making noises as I wake up and get ready. She's almost always content in her crib, but she often is talking or moving around. I hadn't prepared breakfast the night before, so I have to settle for instant oatmeal. There's just enough to make a bowl and after that I'm totally out. I'm grateful there was enough! After eating, I get her dressed and we have to head out right away, because I can't be late to work and I woke up a little later than usual!

* Day care

I'm not sure what prompted me to take a photo this morning, but as I'm dropping her off at her daycare, I just have to snap a pic. She's too cute!

* Southside Park

Mommy wanted to see Noumena again today, so after picking Noumena up I head to Mommy's house to pick her up and head to the park. After looking up parks nearby, I settle on Southside park because it's not too far and it looks like lots of fun.

I think the playground is a little advanced for her, but I can't wait to take her back to this park when she's older! There are so many parks with such different and awesome playgrounds we've found and it's so exciting to have the opportunity to take her to them! Once we reach the playground, I start playing on it, but she seems more interested in the toddler playground close by and starts walking in that direction. Once there, Mom and I are sitting down and I notice her trying to squeeze through the fence. She's such a weird kid. Into such seemingly banal things like gates and corridors and you'd think she'd be more interested in going down slides and stuff. Not my kid I guess!

After some swinging in the toddler swings and crawling through tubes, we head back to the big kids playground. For a little while she swings on the big kid swings. I love her growing and learning.

I'm not even sure how to describe the other equipment she plays on. They're like posts suspended on a joint to pivot from encircled by plastic, upside-down conical platforms near the bottom and tied with a chain to the ground allowing rotational movement. We stand her on one of the platforms and she swings while standing and holding onto the post. She loves it so much she stays on it longer than you'd expect!

Unfortunately, Mommy felt nauseous, so we didn't get to stay too long and Mommy also had stuff she had to do, so we drove her back home and Noumena and I head back home. She falls asleep on the home stretch and maybe sleeps for 5 minutes. It's about 6:30pm when we get home and so I figure she can nap for about 30 minutes before I feed her. I lay her in her crib and she drifts off to sleep.

* Walking Around The Neighborhood

When I wake Noumena up at about 7:15pm, she seems like she's still pretty tired. I had prepared dinner so she could eat right away thinking she'd be hungry, but I was wrong. I think her frustration from being tired made the food quite unappetizing. Nothing would console her, so I took her outside to look for our cat. She loves Kisa so much that when we were looking for her it calmed her down even though we never found her. I brought her back into the house and the tears resumed, so I decided to take her for a jaunt around the neighborhood to look at the neighborhood cats and dogs. Finally she's content! As we approach the house Kisa is waiting for us. I set her down to follow Kisa and Kisa ends up following us back into the house! This is great news because when Kisa's around, there are no tears!

* Home

After a little while of petting Kisa, I sit down to eat the dinner I had left out for us. Noumena, witnessing me eating, decides she's finally hungry, so we have a late dinner at about 7:45pm. She utterly /devours/ the soup I made for her which relieves some of my anxiety about her not getting enough to eat. Despite having worn her Elmo bib, she still manages get her shirt all dirty, so in the process of cleaning up, I remove her shirt and let her walk around shirtless until bath time. We read books, play with toys and wrestle on the bed until it's time to give her a bath.

* Bath & Bed Time

Bath time was typical for the most part except tonight she really wanted to throw her bath toys out of the bath tub! Despite all the difficulties, I'm grateful for her independence and boundary pushing! Even if I'm telling her not to do certain things, I honestly wouldn't have it any other way. The defiance and difficulties are a part of growing up and I'm just grateful I get to be here to witness it and correct it and learn and grow with her.

Speaking of difficulties, every night has turned into a battle royal trying to get her dressed in pajamas for bed! She get frustrated and cries and the wailing turns to laughter and it's truly an emotional roller coaster. She hasn't learned that her daddy is very persistent and can easily over power a toddler yet! Maybe when she does, pajama time will get easier... I'm not holding my breath, though.

I brush her teeth, which she fights me on, of course and we feed the pets before I take her into her room to dance in the dark.

Her usual Pavlovian response kicks in when /Isn't She Lovely/ comes on and she collapses into my chest as I dance her to sleep. She doesn't make it halfway through the song before she's asleep and her white noise machine turns on. I kiss her before laying her down without fuss for the night.

I'm so grateful for ever moment I spend with you Noumena. Good night, my sweetheart. I love you more than you could ever know and I'll do my best to make you experience the depth of it every day of your existence.

* Morning

I slept really poorly the night before. Luckily for me, Noumena slept amazingly as she's wont to do. Despite my poor sleep, I actually woke up earlier than she did! It's good because I didn't prepare breakfast which I usually do and so it gave me some time to do that this morning. I didn't have instant oatmeal, but I had quick cook oatmeal, so I put that in a bowl with some soymilk, heated it up, added a splash of maple syrup for sweetness and went into Noumena's bedroom to wake her up. I pick her up, get her dressed, and we head to the kitchen. The first thing I did was give her a cup of water and she drinks a good amount before we sit down for breakfast. Happily, she loves the oatmeal as much as anything else so we eat quickly and head out the door.

* Picking Up Noumena From Daycare

When I arrive at Noumena's daycare, she's the last kid in her class. When she sees me, as usual she bolts in my direction---arms out stretched and not minding her surroundings thereby bumping in to the corner of a table in her path---straight into my arms. She stops for a moment, considers the sensation left from striking the table, decides it doesn't warrant crying and continues running towards me. I embrace her as she turns into a rag doll in arms succumbing to the shower of kisses I rain down upon her once she's nested in my arms. These are the moments that make life worth living. She's become so sociable, that when I lift her off the ground she says "bye" to the worker presiding over her class. Walking along the pathway towards the exit, she extends the same courtesy to all the children she sees on her way out the door. I spin her around once we're outside telling her how much I love her and missed her as we make our way to the car.

Noumena falls asleep on the car ride home. Once we arrive, I open the door to our home before removing her from the car seat so there's as little friction as possible transferring her to her to her crib for a nap. Unfortunately, she's not as comatose as I had hoped and she wakes up as I remove her from the car seat. Convinced I can get her to go back to sleep however, I take her into her room and rock her to sleep with minimal resistance from her. As I lay her down, she begins to cry a little, but I know it will subside, so I shut her door and sure enough her cries die down in a couple minutes and she drifts to sleep. It's 5:30pm now, so I set a rule that I wouldn't wake her until 7pm because I think I've been waking her up too soon from her naps recently. She's been very cranky when I awaken her on the evenings where she naps. My hope is that allowing her to sleep more will alleviate some of this crankiness. Happily enough, she only sleeps for about 50 minutes before waking up herself at nearly 6:30pm.

Upon awakening, I offer Noumena water do drink and she refuses. I offer her dinner and she refuses once again. Although I think she's less cranky than she has been, it's still very apparent that she's less than content. My recourse in these situations has been to use Kisa to distract her from whatever discontentment has her captive. It works like a charm every time. Failing to find when we go outside, however, I decide the next best thing is to parade her around the neighborhood to observe all the other animals occupy our neck of the woods. So we head to the park.

* Tidewater Acres Park

There's a dog named Harley that we see all the time on our walks, and for the first time, I decide to film how Noumena feels about her. I can't believe I hadn't thought of that until now!

When we arrive at the park, there's a couple there I see from time to time with their children swinging. Since both of there children occupy the toddler swings and Noumena seems to want to swing, I set her on the big kid's swings close to them so she isn't left out. It's always a relief when other children are around. Even with Daddy being as playful as he is, the park is evidently a lot less lackluster when there are others around. Noumena is a people watcher through and through. She's captivated by new people. She observes their behaviors very closely when she first sees them. The children playing prompts her to engage with the playground equipment a lot more which is a relief to me because if it were just me and her at the park, she'd be preoccupied with trying to run into the street! Her favorite game when it's only me and her at the park is forcing Daddy to chase after her when she's doing something she's not supposed to!

When she sees the other kids playing, I think a little bit of her wants to show off. She says "slide" and tries to climb up to the platform to go down. I help her climb the chain ladder letting her exercise her legs in the process as she pulls herself up to the platform to go down the slide. We do this on repeat and every time she reaches the bottom of the slide she says "slide" again and runs over to the chain ladder.

When the other family leaves, that park becomes lackluster again and so I decide to take her home.

* Back At Home

It's almost 8pm when we get home, we have dinner and play in the living room for a short while before it's already bath time.

* Bath & Bed Time

Something I've been doing recently at bath time is hugging Noumena should anything less than ideal happen while bathing. For instance, if she's not too keen on rinsing off her hair---perhaps some water and soap makes it into her eyes and stunted cries begin---she reaches out to me. Even though she's all wet and will therefore get me wet when we embrace, I take her into my arms as she stands in the tub anyway. In a way, the slight inconvenience of being wetted by a soaked baby somehow enhances the experience of comforting her with embrace. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing better than nuzzling your child in some circumstances except doing it in others. But somehow, that I forgo the fact that I don't want to be wet in order to embrace her feels better than were she not wet. Maybe it's the fact that in some small way it exemplifies what you're willing to do for the love of your life that makes it all the better. I don't know how to make sense of it. What should be worse somehow improves the experience. Taking note of this, during tonight's bath, I hug her several times---basically at every opportunity that presents itself.

Wrapping up bath time, Noumena puts all her bath toys away herself and with incredible speed. She truly understands the object of putting her toys away now. We don her pajamas and brush her teeth. Since bath time was later than usual, we omit feeding the pets from our routine and go straight to dancing to our bedtime playlist. She's completely out halfway through /Isn't She Lovely/, so I lay her down. She lets out a few stuttered cries tonight which are quelled by her exhaustion moments later and she succumbs to the tender clasp of sleep.

Usually when she lays down, I take care of cleaning up around the house. Tonight was no different. We have a carved pumpkin and noticing that the stem wasn't affixed to the pumpkin properly, I went to adjust it and upon removing it, I noticed that she had placed her shoes inside of it unbeknownst to me. I'm honestly glad she didn't put the pumpkin lid on properly. Imagine if she had! I'd be wondering where her shoes had gone for what could have been days! I get a good chuckle out of the fact and even as she sleeps, my appreciation and adoration for her deepens.

I didn't feel well when I got off work because of the lack of sleep. I was concerned about how it would affect me tonight, Noumena. That all faded away when we were reunited today. As is typical, the brightness that emanates from you---your infectious happiness---your beautiful soul---awakens me to the present and I'm enveloped by the light and love. Thank you for being part of my life, Noumena. I love you so much and the tears streaming down my face as I write this testify to the fact that without you I'm a shell of a man and with you I am whole.

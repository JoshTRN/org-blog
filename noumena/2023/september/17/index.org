Noumena, I'm so sorry I've been out of it for the last few days only uploading photos and videos. Daddy had a really rough time, but I will start bringing everything back to normal soon!

* Morning

This morning, I didn't feel well, but I think I'm getting over whatever I felt like I was coming down with on Friday. Noumena, for the past couple days, has been waking up because she gets one of her legs caught in between the bars of her crib. She did that at 5am this morning and again at her nap time.

Because I didn't feel well, I had Noumena's mother come by to help take care of her. She came at almost 9am and stayed until about 10:50am. I slept while they were in the living room reading and playing together. I forgot what Mom said she had to do, but after she leaves, since I hadn't eaten all day I wanted to go to lunch. I called the place I wanted to go to order ahead, but they told me they don't take orders over the phone anymore and that I had to order online, so I did.

We had plenty of time before we had to go pick up the food, so I walked with Noumena to CVS to get a red bull before heading to lunch.

* Lunch

We went to a neighborhood called Murray Hill and a restaurant called /The Walrus/ to eat. They make all sorts of vegan dishes and I wanted the sandwiches they make. Once Noumena and I are there, our food is already ready, so I take Noumena to a table, sit down and she eats the sandwiches with me. I gave her the rice-paper bacon and she liked it but what she ate most of was the bread of the sandwich. She also really loved the pickle for some reason. She ate everything but the rind.

After lunch, I thought about going to Riverside park but decided it just to look up the nearest park. When I saw the photos on google of Murray Hill park, I was so excited. It looked like a place Noumena would love. I had no idea how cool it would be.


* Murray Hill Park

Once we get to the park, we saw this giant fountain with multiple spouts shooting water out of the ground! At first I was a little disappointed because I wasn't prepared, so we sat on the swings and swing together. It was awesome and Noumena absolutely loved it.

** Fountain Play

After thinking about it for a little, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to let Noumena play in the fountain. I figured that even though I didn't have a bathing suit, since I had diapers in the car, she could just stay in the diaper and I'd take off the rest of her clothes so she could have something dry to wear after. I could even use my shirt to dry her off afterward if it was necessary. We went to the car, grabbed the backpack, and headed back into the park.

She hesitated at first, holding onto Daddy's hand making sure it was safe to venture into the water and it was so cute!

Right before we leave, I decide to put her back in that swing to dry her off before changing back into her clothes. We meet a baby girl just a few months older than Noumena named Eden also swinging with us. We swing until all but Noumena's diaper is dry before taking her to the car to get changed back into her clothes. We have a ~18 minute ride home and I tried keeping her awake the whole way. She got to within 5 minutes of home before she couldn't keep her eyes open any longer. She didn't even fuss at all while she was falling asleep. She was just too tired.

When I pulled her out of her car seat, she wouldn't even open her eyes. She immediately laid her head against my chest as I carried her into the house and her bedroom for a nap. Of course she went down without a fuss at about 2pm and slept for about 2Â½ hours.

* Chuck E. Cheese

Noumena's mother wanted to take her to Chuck E. Cheese. I didn't go with them because I had grocery shopping I wanted to do, but Noumena's mother sent a video of them riding the carousel!

Noumena's mom went to go to a meeting with her friend after I got back from shopping, so we walked with her to her car. I don't even know what I want to do tonight, so I just decide to take Noumena to the park.

* Park

Surprisingly, Noumena spent most of her time at the park on or around the swings. She usually likes to wander more, so this is a bit of a surprise. Anyway, I'm trying to figure out if she just wants to mess with the big kid swings, but at some point it becomes apparent that she just wants to try to swing in them. I let her take the risk!

* Home

We get home at about 8:00pm which means we have around a half hour to just hangout before bath time. She plays independently in the living room and I just admire her until it's time for bath.

* Bath Time

When I set Noumena in the bath tub, she initially tried to get out, but I force her back in! So she starts playing with the faucet. I'm not sure what prompted me to scream out when she touched it, probably the fact that I didn't want her to get water everywhere, but she runs to me when she does. It's so cute that I have to film it.

I'm not sure what put the idea in my head, but I often stick her foam letters and numbers to her. This time I threw them at her and they started sticking! It was so funny!

* Bed Time

We got in the bath a little late and we're also playing while I'm getting Noumena dressed in her pajamas, so instead of our usual routine of feeding the pets, tonight we just brush her teeth before I take her in her room to dance to music as she falls asleep. As is normal, Noumena's head collapses into me before the music even turns on. She's asleep halfway through /Isn't She Lovely/ but I hold her and sway through /Stand By Me/ before laying her down for a good night sleep.


I had so much fun with you today, Noumena. I'm happy I'm feeling better and I'm so excited to spend the week with you, but I'm so sad I have to take you to daycare! I love you, sweet baby. Please sleep well! Good night!

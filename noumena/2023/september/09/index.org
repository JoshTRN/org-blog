* Morning

To my surprise, Noumena didn't get up until almost 8:30am. She had been waking up earlier and so I thought it would be a pattern. I heard her moving around and whining. She seemed a little more discontent than she usually is in the mornings. Normally, she just lays in there and talks to herself and that's how I know she's awake, but she was distinctly whining this morning. I prepared her porridge and walked into her room to get her.


After we finish eating, I leave her outfit choice up to her. Funnily enough, I offered 2 purple outfits a dark purple outfit and a light purple one. I first held the light purple outfit in my left hand and the dark purple one in my right. When she pointed and touched the light purple one with her right index finger, I was skeptical she was actually choosing it, so I switched the outfits to the opposite hand. Sure enough, she reached out with her left index finger and touched the light purple outfit again. That settles it! Light purple it is. I lay her clothes down beside her as I apply her diaper. She picked up her shirt and appeared to try to dress herself, so I tried to capture the moment, but she was less cooperative once I started filming.

Upon dressing Noumena, we have a little while before we have to leave for story time. She selects her owl books out of the cabinet and brings them over for me to read. I read them several times for her and she helps me fold our laundry and put it away before it's time for us to head out to the library for story time.

* Story Time

We get to the library a little early and so head to the playroom to play before story time starts. I had lost track of time in the playroom. One of the reasons I lost the time is that she first says "yellow" when I show her something yellow and attempt to get her to mimic me. I'm so amazed and her language acquisition recently! One of the library workers came to ask if we wanted to go to story time, so we popped right up and headed that way unfortunately missing the /Hello Friends/ song.

The story time instructor is new. It was a different new one last week as well. The stories were all about opposites today, which is the same as when Noumena started story time. I can't remember if she started story time at 4 months old, but it feels like maybe she did. I presume it was then because I think maybe they cycle the story time themes annually. If that's true, wow... a whole year since she started story time. Where did the time go? It doesn't matter how many times you're told the years go by fast, you just never get the perspective until you're in the situation. The last year seems to have raced away.

Noumena seems to pay extra special attention today. I'm not sure what's different, but she's much more captivated by story time than she is usually. Maybe it's because her language acquisition seems to be occurring at such a remarkable rate. In any case, it's a bit refreshing to not have to monitor her so closely.

After story time, we play in the courtyard a bit. I let her wander and we play hide and seek.

* James Weldon Johnson Park

When we leave the library, there are some events going on at the park across the street. I had intended on going over there after story time anyway, but this just seems like a bonus! There's an animal transportation trailer that had carried a petting zoo directly across the library doors. As we cross the street, I say to Noumena "smells like animal cruelty." Right as we pass the vehicle, the petting zoo is visible. I go over there to investigate perfectly willing to pay to let Noumena touch the animals, but it's apparently free. They keep them in these minuscule cages, I feel bad for them. Maybe they don't want it, but what can we do besides offer them kindness? I suppose leave them alone. I don't know. Poor animals.

Moving on from he petting zoo, there's more stuff going on. I'm not sure I really follow all of it, all I know is that I saw 2 big bubble making machines and I want Noumena to check them out so we head over there. Once we get there, there's also sidewalk chalk on the ground, so of course I show Noumena how to play with it and I got some good photos in the process!

* Home And Lunch

It's earlier than Noumena's normal nap time by the time we get home, but she seems cranky when we arrive. Because she's cranky, I don't want to try to cook and have to attend to her at the same time, so I lay her down for a nap. She falls asleep at about noon, which is earlier than I usually let her take her nap, but it's fine. If I don't let her sleep too long, she'll take another nap in the afternoon.

[[file:waking-up-from-nap.jpg]]

While she was napping, I cooked up some tofu scramble. I also prepared an avocado, but I'm really reluctant about eating avocados if they're not pristine. Call it paranoia, but they just seem to spoil so fast. Anyway, she eats none of the avocado and a ton of the tofu scramble. The parts of the avocado I had were good, so I guess it's fine.

Also while she was napping, Noumena's mother decided she was going to come back early from her weekend trip and spend time with Noumena, so I told her we were going to tree hill nature center and she later met us there.

* Tree Hill Nature Center

Just before we exit the door, I set Noumena down since Kisa is laying on the Adirondack chairs on our porch. As Noumena approaches, Kisa removes herself from the chair. Noumena follows and ends up seated on the porch with Kisa in front of her.

We head off to the nature center.


Upon arrival, we see the goats and the chickens all in the same pen together. We spend maybe 10 minutes just hanging out with them.

* Home

It's a little after 5pm when we get home and I put Noumena down for another nap. I let her sleep until 6:15pm. When I get her up I try to feed her dinner, but she's just not hungry. I tried giving her black bean soup and she wouldn't eat that. She wouldn't eat dates and she also wouldn't eat bread. Literally all the stuff she likes she wouldn't eat. She fed the bread to Chalmers. I was forced to conclude she simply wasn't hungry.

I had to get some baby supplied and also a few household items so I packed Noumena into the car at around 7pm and headed to Walmart.

* Walmart

Once at Walmart, I make a quick effort to get the diapers and wipes I had come there for. We make quick work of getting all the other supplies so that we could hang out in the toy isle and play with all the stuff!

We finished our shopping, but they didn't have any soymilk. I like buying it there because it's cheaper than at Publix, but since they didn't have any, it's the same price as at target and target is on the way home, so we head there as well. We get one thing and then head out arriving at home at about 8:20pm.

* Bath/Bed Time

I'm a little bit distracted as I'm bathing Noumena, so we stay there a little longer than usual. She's brilliant as ever though. She gives me no problems when bathing her. Even when we finish, she's nice when I'm getting her dressed, not fighting back and also brushing her teeth is a breeze! She's such a good girl!


Noumena is out cold by the time /Isn't She Lovely/ is finished. I hold her all the way through /Stand By Me/ though because my favorite thing to do in the world is let her sleep against my chest. I move her to a cradled position about halfway through, kissing her a few times before laying her in her crib. She makes no fuss and goes to bed perfectly peacefully.


Noumena, we had so much fun today and Daddy didn't even intend all of it! It's so fun being spontaneous with you and being surprised by what life has in store. I can't wait to learn what it has in store for us tomorrow! Sleep amazingly, my beautiful little girl! You're already missed as you lay in your crib and daddy writes this thinking about you. You are my everything, baby, and I always want you to remember that. I want you to know that I would crawl through the depths of hell for you. There is no sacrifice I'm not willing to make to you to make sure you're happy and healthy and can make sense of this mess we call life. I would do anything for you, baby girl. I hope you know and feel that with each passing day.

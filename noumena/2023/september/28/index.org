* Morning

I stayed up a little too late last night, so Noumena's cries are what awoke me at about 8:50am. I usually set an alarm for earlier than that, but I had changed it recently, so I slept all the way until she started whining in her crib. I hadn't prepared breakfast last night, so I needed to use the quick cook oatmeal for her breakfast. I put it in the microwave before going into her room to get her out of crib, but let it cook while I went into her room to get her ready for the day. You could tell she was hungry right when she woke up. She noticed the microwave still whirring when we got to the kitchen, declining to drink water as food was obviously the more pressing issue.

Noumena didn't even want to let it finish cooking. She reached her arm out to open the door finding herself too weak perhaps at her current angle to open in which led to a frustrated whine. It had cooked enough, so I removed the bowl and added some maple syrup. First putting the bowl in the freezer to cool for a moment before sitting down at the table, I realized that was just not going to work. She was far too focused, hungry and determined to eat that her cries reflected it. So strong was her desire to eat that she would hardly let me blow on it to cool it down before giving it to her.

I became a human oatmeal-conveyor belt skimming a small amount off the top and blowing on it for the duration it took to traverse from the bowl to her mouth. Immediately as Noumena ingested one bite, the next small portion was on the spoon headed towards her mouth on this daddy conveyor belt of oatmeal. It was like this the hole duration of the meal. I'm not complaining. I'm glad she ate fast as I was already running late.

After getting her dressed, which was pleasantly easy this morning, I set her up in her car seat with her Elmo book which I had decided to bring along with us this morning and also the usual toys she has in the car for our trip to daycare.

* Daycare

When I arrived to pick Noumena up from daycare, she was eating a 5pm snack. This is unusual. They typically last feed the children at about 2pm, but I have to say I'm grateful for the change up today. I'm always concerned with whether she's eating enough, so it was a bit relieving that she would have a snack in her belly as we drove home. When her eyes met mine, it was the most conflicted I'd ever seen her. She was still eating the chex mix in a bowl they'd given her and not about to stop, so she looked at me, stood up from her chair, looked back at her food and started pondering what to do. "I know," you could see the cogs spinning, "I'll just take the food with me!" she thought as stood from the chair, picked up the bowl and started carrying it towards Daddy.

I assured Noumena that she didn't have to do that and that I would wait patiently beside her as she finished her meal. Once she's finished eating, I take a step back giving her the opportunity to run into my arms. She doesn't disappoint, but still thinks the styrofoam bowl is an important accessory, so she takes that with her when she runs into my arms. Of course I hold her and hug her and tell her how much I love her and missed her. As I pick her up, she takes a bite out of the corner of the bowl! We put a stop to that, throwing it away. One of the workers comes by and tries to wipe her mouth off, but Noumena resists, so I take over. It's often easy for me to do as I turn it into a game, so instead of fighting, it's funny when Daddy succeeds at cleaning her off. With that we say goodbye and embark on our trip home.

* Arriving Home


[[file:touching-kisa.jpg]]

[[file:standing-next-to-kisa.jpg]]

When Noumena and I arrive home, Kisa is laying in the front lawn in the exact same position she was when I left to pick Noumena up 30 minutes ago. Noumena loves being outside so much and she also is enamored with Kisa, so I set her down to greet Kisa and play in the front yard. I had initially planned to just take Noumena to the park from the front yard not even entering the house, but when I started carrying her, I could smell that she had soiled her diaper, so I have to change it. We inside and begin the wrestling match that is changing her diaper. She's really taken to putting up a huge fight all while having fecal matter stuck to her butt so that's exciting, but eventually she succumbs and I get her back into a new diaper and clothes. I wasn't sure if she'd touched her dirty bottom while I was changing her, so I wash her hands.

While cleaning her hands, Noumena sees the sour dough bread I had bought on my lunch hour to eat with the chili I'd made earlier in the week, so naturally she wants some. I give her a slice, and she comes back for seconds but not before taunting Chalmers and ultimately getting her bread stolen by him leading to one of the cutest tantrums.

* Walk To The Park

Noumena is none too happy about me carrying her as we get outside. She wants to venture off herself as usual. I tried to guide her with my hand to walk with me down the street to the park, but, determined to exercise her independence, every time I pull her by the hand in the right direction, she tries to let go of my hand and when I don't let go of hers and continue pulling,"no, no, no, no" is the phrase that leaves her mouth as her legs transform into wet noodles beneath her torso as if by some stroke of magic and she collapses to the ground. Obviously I'll have to carry her.

Unfortunately, our dog friend Harley isn't out, but on our way to the park, the chickens that we see infrequently are traipsing around the yard they hang out in, so I stop and set her down letting her investigate. This is short-lived and we continue on our expedition.

When we get to the end of the block, across the street are geese wandering about in the patch of grass in the church parking lot. I can't let her miss this opportunity to say hi to the geese, so I set her down.

I leave Noumena in the patch of grass even after she's done chasing the geese to explore eventually wandering up to a white mushroom. I tell her that we don't pick up strange mushrooms and that unknown mushrooms are very unsafe and to my surprise and delight, she seems to listen leaving it behind as she heads towards a small man-made canal that sits adjacent to the church. Obviously, she can't be allowed to go down there, but she certainly wants to and when I tell her "no" she starts throwing a fit. Even acting crazy and goofy isn't helping distract her from her fit, but we did see a man throwing tennis balls for his dog. I head over there in attempt to subdue the cries. I had initially just intended on letting her watch, but the man assures me that his dog is extremely nice, so I set her down and allow her to play. Strangely, she's more interested in the tennis balls than the dog, which is seemingly very out of character. I introduce myself to the man named John and we talk a little about his dog, Kody, while Noumena throws the tennis ball for him before we head off to the park.

* Tidewater Acres Park

I was so excited upon approaching the park because there are other children there. A man named Say (spelled literally that way. I know because he told me) is swinging his eldest daughter, Saraya, (his youngest wasn't with him) in the toddler swing. I synchronize Noumena's swings with Saraya's and they both and they both have a great time!

Eventually Noumena says "slide" indicating that she'd like to get down to go down the slide. The funny thing is that she's usually so disinterested in the playground equipment at the park. She's been there a thousand times---a funny exaggeration as she hasn't even been alive for a thousand days---so she's usually rather disinterested. However, there being other children to show off in front of, she takes the opportunity to strut her stuff, showing Saraya what she's capable of and head up the stairs to the slide. She slides multiple times both before and after Saraya. She remains focused on the playground equipment for the majority of the rest of the time we're there.

* Home

When we get home, I turn on music for me and Noumena to listen to while we engage in our typical activities. She picks up a piece of mail addressed to her mother off the table and I don't want her messing with it, so I sit down and start reading her books aloud to myself in order to make her feel left out and prompt her to investigate the books. There's nothing quite as satisfying as manipulating toddlers, bending them to your tyrannical whims! Of course my tactic works and she comes over to read the book with me. In rapid succession, she tires of the book I'm reading and hands me another to read aloud... and another... and another... I think I read all the books she had access to at that time including /Sheep In A Jeep/ and her Elmo book.

This turns into running around the house and eventually she's in the kitchen whining for more bread. Since she hadn't eaten much since she was home, I figure I'll allow more bread. Definitely a model dinner tonight! Of course, this wouldn't be complete without taunting Chalmers!

After eating, we end up running around. I run my unlit bedroom motivating Noumena to follow. I first hide behind the wall, but then jump over the bed to hide behind it on the other side in the darkened room. This horseplay continues until we end up on the bed with Chalmers. At this point, she's tuckered out. Her blanket was on the bed, so she snuggles up to it. I love it because since she's tired, she's willing to be closer and laying down without having to go somewhere and do something and expend all her excess energy. It affords me the opportunity to lay next to her and just fall in love with her beautiful face up close and personally. She's taken to pointing out and naming my facial features, so when I'm laying there and she points to my eyes and says "eye" and then transitions to pointing at my nose saying "no-" she's completely oblivious to the fact that she has me wrapped around her finger as I stare blissfully at the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. I'm completely enamored, enthralled by her magnificence. Not only do I never want to forget this moment, I never want it to end.

* Bath & Bed Time

We lay in bed until it's bath time even going to take a bath a little bit later than usual. The only significant thing about it is that recently Noumena's started peeing right as she enters the tub. It's funny because she's always standing when she does it. Instead of it running down her leg as you'd sort of expect, the stream shoots in front of her as she watches it fascinated by the workings of her own body. It's truly a hilarious sight to see. She's been really helpful in putting her toys away lately. She understands what she's supposed to do and just does it. It's so great.

Thankfully, getting her dressed isn't much of a battle. Although, after I get her diaper on, she stands so I have to dress her standing. I've grown accustomed to the fact that she doesn't like laying down to get dressed anymore so I just try to dress her while she stands. She's gotten pretty cooperative about it as long as she's standing, so that's good. She's also gotten super cooperative about brushing her teeth giving me no hassle whatsoever like she used to.

I take her in her room and she collapses into my chest for us to listen to our bedtime playlist. She's out almost immediately. I'm not surprised as she hasn't napped at all since probably noon. Nevertheless, I rock her to /Isn't She Lovely/ and /Stand By Me/ before laying he to bed.


I was so present with you tonight Noumena which is something I lose track of from time to time. It's strange. I know that the best feelings I've ever had in my entire life have been when I'm there in the moment with you, yet sometimes I get swept away in thought, concerned with other moments not yet or no longer here. Hypothetical and irrelevant moments to this one. I'm not sure what makes a mind like that. All I know is that I don't want to allow it to stay that way. The only thing that matters in this world to me anymore are the moments I spend with you, Noumena. They are my everything. Because of that, I'll work harder to be more and more present with you every day. After all, it is literally the best thing I could be doing.

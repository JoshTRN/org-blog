* Morning

This morning we woke up pretty late about 8:15am. It was another instant oatmeal day because I didn't prepare ahead of time. Noumena's awake when I enter her room and she's trying to talk to me. I don't know what she's talking about, but I always love when she tries to express herself. I'm so excited for when she can use sentences to express herself! We eat the oatmeal and head off to daycare right away because I can't be late for work.

* Cancer Survivors Park

Every time I pick Noumena up from daycare, she comes rushing to me with arms outstretched. It's never going to get old and it's going to end too soon. Because Noumena likes bridges so much, Noumena's mom found a park that had a bunch of bridges that was right outside of a cancer treatment center called cancer survivors park. I didn't read all the plaques, but I assume the bridges are to represent traversing difficulties. Anyway, Noumena didn't seem to like it as much as we thought she would. I was totally excited to take her there, but she seemed pretty underwhelmed.

Mommy fed Noumena peanut butter crackers and dried coconut flakes while sitting on the benches and gave her water to wash it down.

I wanted Noumena to get the opportunity to run around a little more so I asked Mom if she wanted to join us at Riverside Park and of course she said yes so we took off.

We parked across the street at the gas station and went inside to get drinks before heading across the street to the park. We saw ducks standing atop debris floating in the water that looked to be remnants of a fence of some kind. Noumena was fascinated. At first we didn't see the sign that said not to feed the birds, so Noumena got the opportunity to feed the geese and ibises that were wondering around.

After we were done playing with the birds, we turned our attention to the playground. She bounced on the bridge with Mommy and went down the slide once, but the main activity that she really loved was playing catch with balls the other kids had brought with them.

We left shortly after, dropped Mommy off and drove home to eat dinner first stopping at the grocery store to get some bread and butter.

* Dinner

On my lunch break, I had made veggie soup. I was certain that Noumena wouldn't eat much since she had snacked with mom and seemed to have eaten a lot, but boy was I wrong. She devoured that soup like she had never eaten before. It made me happy because there's a lot of nutrients in that soup. She went back for thirds!

* Home

I neglected to put a bib on Noumena for dinner, so of course she made a total mess out of her shirt. I wanted to take her out again since it was only 7pm meaning we had plenty of time to play around, so I changed her into a mismatching shirt. She wandered around without a shirt chasing Chalmers and it was really cute. I tried to get a video but I was too late. She wore a pink, frilly top with a purple skirt and it was amazingly cute!

* Tidewater Acres Park

I took her to the park near our house just because I didn't know what else to do. Wispy, orange clouds line the sky for our peaceful evening jaunt. I talked about a movie I recently watched on the phone with friends while she played around. First, she went on the swings, but that was pretty much it for playground play. Instead, Noumena's been obsessed with gates. I can't figure out what it is. But this park has a gate that she can open and shut because the latch is broken. I'm not kidding when I say she spends the majority of her time perhaps twenty minutes opening and shutting this gate and wandering back and fourth over the sidewalk under it which separates the park from the roadside.

* Back At Home

I'm pretty tired, so we spend the rest of the evening just hanging out on the bed. She's totally enjoying just being up there with me and Chalmers periodically cycling between the two of us deciding which appendages are appropriate toys at whichever point in time.

* Bath & Bed Time

Our bath is standard tonight, but we got in the bath a little late. Noumena's giving me a hell of a time trying to change her, but it's all fun and games to me. She keeps rotating and I'm pretending like I'm mad about it and flipping her over, but eventually I get her dressed and declare my victory over my 16 month old child! We brush her teeth and take her right in the bedroom to go to bed.

Noumena had such a busy day! Three parks in one day! She's asleep before /Isn't She Lovely/ is even halfway through. I hold her until her white noise machine comes on and when I lay her in bed, she stays without fuss.

There are these glimpses during my time with her every day where I'm entirely present. Fleeting moments where I'm looking at her completely engrossed by her facial features gazing in love and admiration. There's not a day that goes by, Noumena, that I don't see you this way. When I'm present this way, nothing else matters. You are all there is to me and I would do anything for you. Sleep tight, baby girl. I'll see you in the morning.

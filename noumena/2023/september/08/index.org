* Morning

This morning was another morning of Noumena not allowing me to sleep in. I guess 7:30am isn't too bad to get up. I suspect she's going to do the same tomorrow as well. So, I get her porridge ready and Chalmers and I go into her room to get her up. For some reason, she doesn't want me to take her out of her crib. She sits in the corner and talks a little while holding her blanket, so I asked her if she wanted to throw it out. She moves closer, but doesn't really react to the blanket, so I yank her out of bed and she starts saying hi to Chalmers.

Once again, Noumena fusses while I'm trying to feed her. It's clear she wants be a big girl and feed herself with a spoon, so I head to the kitchen and grab one. It's a little bit messier, but she does a fine job.

After eating, I tell Noumena we need to get dressed and to follow me to her room. She obliges and when we get there, I have her pick out her outfit for the day. I hold up her purple and white outfits and ask her to choose between them. She picks white, so that's what we go with. I get her dressed and we head out to the car to go to daycare.

* Picking Up Noumena from daycare

[[file:eating-with-friends.jpg]]

I took off work about a half hour early because I missed Noumena so much. When I arrive, she's eating cheese crackers with her friends. What's funny is that she must have been hungry because she didn't seem to come rushing to me when I got there. Instead, I came up next to her and sat beside her while she ate. Once she was done though, she got out of her and fell into my arms for a sustained hug. There truly is no greater feeling in the world than being loved by your child. I spin her around holding her in a hug before we leave the daycare and head out to the car.

On the ride home, Noumena falls asleep. She barely fussed when she fell asleep so I knew she was tired. When we arrive at home, I draped her blanket over my shoulder, pull her out of car seat, rest her head against the blanket on my shoulder, and bring her into the house. She does rest a little against my shoulder, but also seems somewhat alert as we enter the home. I turned on her white noise machine and laid her down for a nap. She cried for about a minute before the crying stopped and I thought for sure she had gone to sleep. A few minutes later though, I heard her talking to herself. And then I heard her moving around and banging on her changing table. I let her in there maybe 15 minutes by herself and she just would not go to sleep... I didn't understand because I know she's tired.

* Hanging out At Home

I take her out of her crib and we hang out around the house for a little bit. I'm not sure what made me get the pistachios out of the pantry, but I did and I know Noumena absolutely loved them. In fact, she loved them a little too much because when I decided she'd had enough, she threw a fit about it!

I have no idea what I'm going to do with this kid. I decide we should go to the park near our house, but then when we go to leave the house, I set Noumena down so I can lock the door and she starts walking near the side of the house. I thought it might be interesting to go looking for Kisa with her so that's what we did.

* Tidewater Acres Park

I don't know why I never specify the name of the park by our house, but it's called Tidewater Acres park.  There were a couple little girls there when we arrived, so I was excited for Noumena to get to play with them. Sadly, they left literally just as we arrived. I set her on the ground to decide what to do first. She points to the swings and says her closest approximation to the word "swing" so of course I take her over there and swing her around for a little while.

Not long after, Noumena wants down. But when I get her down it's not clear what she wants to do. I run up to the playground to try to get her to come after me, she does a little bit, but never really scales the platforms. I do get her close to the slide once, but she doesn't want to go down. I'm not sure what's going on, but she still seems tired.

I think she needs to eat dinner because I don't think the pistachios were enough, so I pick her up and we head home. When I tried feeding her the black bean soup, however, she wouldn't eat it! Then I thought well maybe I'll give her a date or some bread. I tried both and she just wouldn't eat either. Somehow she's simply not hungry. I obviously can't force her to eat So we hangout at home for a little bit.

When we're spending time at home, she's not satisfied with anything. She's a very cranky baby. It's almost 7pm, so It's way too late to let her take a nap, but I have to do something to stop her from being whiny, so I decide to take her to another nearby park, Arlingwood park.

* Arlingwood Park

Noumena falls asleep on the ride to Arlingwood park, but she does so only when we're about 3 minutes away. I feel bad for waking her up, so I let her sleep for about 5 minutes more once we arrive. As we arrive at the park, there are 2 little girls there! Again I get excited for Noumena to play with new friends. Once again, I'm disappointed as they're leaving just as we're arriving. I'm starting to think I have cooties!

Noumena is so tired she just will not play at the park. It's crazy. The only thing that keeps her entertained basically is me running around. I was grateful for the fact that I had a lot of energy so I could run around and keep her interested. I do a lot of spinning her around by her arms in the field, some spinning around by her legs and eventually, I plop her on my shoulders and just run around the sidewalk at the park! I think that's her favorite of all the things!

At about 7:40-ish we head back to the car where I give her the water bottle I had prepared for her before we went to the park. She drinks a bit of it as do I and then we head home. She's fussy, so I have to caress her arm from the front seat the entire ride home to calm her down.

* Home From Park

[[file:so-tired-baby.jpg]]

When we arrive, Noumena is in such a terrible mood because of how tired she is. I set her down and she whines and cries on her blanket on the floor. But then she starts moving her books around that I was reading to her earlier. Eventually, I start reading it again and she's gotten distracted from her fatigue by the book. Eventually, she sits next to my head as I was laying there and she starts touching my face so I started telling her which facial features those were. To my surprise she says them all! She says, "eyes" and "mouth" and "nose"!!! I'm so excited! I'm sure every parent feels this way when their kid starts talking, but I feel like Noumena is a genius!!!

* Bath/Bed Time

We basically do that until she's ready to take a bath. Once again, during the bath she's absolutely wonderful. She lets me shampoo her and rinse her head off with minimal issues. I'm so proud of my girl growing up. She helps me put all her toys away also. She understands what it means to say "put away this toy." She's just developing at what feels like breakneck pace. It's good. She'll grow up to be able to answer all the philosophical questions her daddy is to stupid to know the answers to. I take her out, get her dressed and head to brush her teeth and feed the pets.

It should come as no surprise that as soon as we're in her room with the lights out, her head is collapsed against my shoulder. We listen to /Isn't She Lovely/ and /Stand By Me/ but she's totally out by the end of /Isn't She Lovely/.

Noumena, even though you were crabby because you didn't nap, I still loved spending time with you! It's just you and me this weekend baby girl! What are we going to do!?! I'm so excited!

I'll see you in the morning, precious! I hope you have the sweetest of dreams!

* Morning

This morning, Noumena woke up at 8am. I'm glad that last night I prepared the overnight oats. I didn't go grocery shopping over the weekend and I didn't have the time to make porridge so for the next week, she and I are probably going to be eating overnight oats in the mornings. As I enter her room, she reaches for me and then quickly changes her mind and rolls over. She's so funny. I let her roll around for a little while before she decides she wants to be picked up. We head to the kitchen, get her food out of the refrigerator and we sit down to eat together.

Just as soon as Noumena's done eating, I have to use the restroom, so I set her down. She heads into the living room from the dining room in anticipation of play with the dog, but then turns around, sees me walking away and slowly begins to realize that I'm going to be doing something else. She can't have that, so she starts crying. I'm halfway down the hall when she starts crying and I'm not about to stop what I'm doing so I tell her to follow me. I say "C'mon!" repeatedly to get her to come. She doesn't come until I'm well out of view, but while she walks she cries the whole time. Once she reaches the bedroom where the bathroom is, since she knows I'm in the bathroom and wants me to come pick her up, she lays on the floor to pout and hits her body against the wall adjacency wall from the bedroom to bathroom. While on the floor, she realizes that I'm not coming as I'm seated on the toilet, but instead of getting up and walking into the bathroom, I see her head slowly peek from around the corner. She hasn't stood up, merely wormed her way up to the bathroom door. I can't contain my laughter. When I begin to laugh, she throws her hands above her head and begins to cry harder. This just intensifies the comedy!

When I finished, I scooped her up, got her dressed in the outfit she chose, and we head out the door to daycare.

* Home From Daycare

I missed her so much, I left work an hour early to go get her. When I arrive at her daycare, she had apparently dirtied her skirt and run out of bottoms, so she was wondering around in her diaper and it was hilarious. She immediately came running up to me and was so excited to see me she wouldn't even allow me to open the gate before demanding I pick her up. Of course I have to. As we're exiting the, one of the girls wants to give Noumena a hug. I bend down and let her hug Noumena and then another kid wants a hug. I try it out, but Noumena starts grabbing their face. I don't want her to do that, so I just hug the other kid... Now all eight of them standing in my way want hugs! I got a few but then I tried to get out the door. As I'm exiting, I heard one of the boys who wanted a hug bemoan the fact that he didn't receive one... It pulls on my heart strings and I have to go back to give him one. I end up giving all 8 of them about 2 more hugs as luck would have it before getting out the door.

I don't know how I didn't notice until I got home, but they had labeled something of hers with masking tape and that tape found its way onto her back somehow. I joked with a friend that it was how I keep track of her.

Since she wasn't wearing any bottoms, we head into her room to put some on. When there, I remember that she doesn't have any clean pajamas, so we start a load of laundry. I get Noumena to help me put her dirty clothes in the basket.

When I put the laundry in, Noumena's wandering around the garage. We can't actually go outside today because of the rain, so I opt to just let her play in the garage as long as she's entertained. I sit back and just observe her going from toy to toy in the garage.

Like I said, I didn't go grocery shopping, so her dinner is just cobbled together. I give her bread, instant oatmeal, green beans and a date. She's actually very fussy after she eats and it's about 6pm. I didn't want to give her a nap since it was so late, but I don't know what else to do about her whining for no apparent reason. She has to be tired, so I lay her down for a nap at about 6:15. She sleeps until 7pm.

After waking up, I can't stand to be inside anymore and I know Noumena can't so we head outside anyway. I guess we're just getting wet!

* Walmart

It's around 7:40pm and I realize I don't have the soymilk I need to make us breakfast. I go to walmart because it's so much cheaper than publix, but they're often out. I head there with Noumena and they're unfortunately out of unsweetened so I settle for the original soymilk. We don't stay long, but I get her some of the pistachios she likes so much while we head through the isles at the store.

* Bath & Bed Time

[[file:wearing-mommys-pajamas.jpg]]

It's almost time for bath by the time we get back from the store. We wonder around a little and I try to clean up, but there really isn't much time. I get her into the bath and she does 2 things that she's never done before. Firstly, she starts trying to suck on the tub faucet. I have no idea why she's doing this, but she does it for a while. Second, she tries to get out of the tub multiple times. I think it's because Kisa was eating while Noumena was bathing. I obviously can't let her do that, so she gets a little mad, but once I get her distracted, cleaning her is a breeze.

Her Halloween pajamas are still in the living room because when she was helping me fold laundry it was actually very difficult to get anything done. After putting on the diaper, we head to the living room to put on the pajamas.

When I take her back into her dark bedroom, we listen to /Isn't She Lovely/ but she doesn't appear to be tired at all. Halfway through our listening, I move her to a cradled position. We listen to /Stand By Me/ as I cradle her in my arms. Surprisingly, she's not asleep. I lay her in her crib anyway and without fuss, she just rolls over. I'm not sure how long she stayed awake, but she didn't whine at all after I shut the room to her bedroom door. I'm so proud and impressed with my mature little girl!!!

* Morning

I find it strange that when I went into Noumena's room she was pretending to be asleep given that she absolutely would not let me sleep in this morning. I went to bed somewhat late, so it was doubly rough that she woke up early. She woke up at 7:30am. I tried letting her complain for a little while and seeing if she'd go back to sleep, but she wasn't having it, so I got out of bed and dressed and prepared Noumena's breakfast. When I get in her room, she looks like she's asleep! but she was making lots of noise just a minute ago, so I know she's faking it! It's adorable.

I ate porridge with Noumena today. She was less picky about me feeding her, so I got to do that also. Since we're up a little early, we get some time to play around in the living room before leaving for daycare. We read her book and play with a few toys before heading out.

* Dinner With Mommy

Yesterday, Noumena's mother told me she wasn't going to be around this weekend so she asked me if she could see Noumena today. Of course, I said yes, so after I pick Noumena up from daycare, we pick Mommy up from where she stays and we head to Olive Garden.

When we get there, it takes a while for us to get our orders so Mommy sings wheels on the bus with Noumena. We also play with the sugar packets and goof around. Noumena gets on the table and I have to get her down. She gets upset about it and starts throwing a fit. I've dealt with fits so much at this point, I don't even care anymore. I just talk her through them or distract her. Since she's having a hard time, we go outside for a little bit and when we get back inside our food has arrived. Noumena got pizza and Mommy and I shared some of our food with her.

We drop Mommy off at her home before heading back. Noumena's asleep in her car seat before we ever even get to Mommy's house and it's a 10 minute car ride back to our house from Mommy's, so she gets about a 20 minute nap. I wake her up right as we arrive home at 7pm on the dot. As I unload her from the car, we see Miss Theresa, so we go over to say hi.

* Spending Time With Miss Theresa

[[file:noumen-rides-jeremias-car-2.jpg]]

Miss Theresa is on the phone when we get there, so we just sit for a little while on the porch until she's done. Miss Theresa used to babysit Noumena so I think Noumena's sometimes afraid I'm going to leave her with Theresa, but since I haven't and we've been going over there frequently, she's starting to loosen up. Noumena see's Jeremiah's toy car and decides she wants to ride it so I let her do that. Shortly after, Jeremiah comes out of the house and decides to help out.

I debated whether or not we should go to the park eventually landing on that we should, so we say goodbye to Miss Theresa and head on our way there.

* Park

[[file:dog-in-swing.jpg]]

When we got to the park there was a teenage girl petting a cat. I asked if the cat was hers and she said that she's not, but basically she is. That it's a neighborhood cat that comes around her a lot and she's grown to love her and named her "Deedee". I rolled with it. The cat was so friendly it came right up to us. Noumena didn't touch the cat, but I pet it a couple times as she watched on. She would often say "cat," so I knew she was intrigued.

After a little while a dog arrives. Noumena can't say "dog" yet, but she's almost there, I can feel it. Anyway the owners of this dog put it in the baby swing and start swinging it. I usually don't include stuff that's not about Noumena in these journal entries, but who could pass this up??? I know Noumena would not want to forget this!!!

After the dog leaves the swing, Noumena occupies the swing the dog was just in. We swing for a little while but then it's time to go home. For some reason I really wanted to listen to music, so we listen to BILO on the way home and Noumena's having a great time the entire way which of course I absorbed via osmosis and had a wonderful time on the walk back myself.

I gave Noumena a cup of water when we got home and went to the restroom while she drank it. When I came out of the restroom, she placed the cup facing up in the correct position on the couch. Upon investigation, the cup was entirely empty and Noumena hadn't spilled anywhere that I could see. Noumena drank a full cup of water all by herself like a big girl without making any mess!!!

* Bath Time

We go to take a bath and I don't even have to be extra careful when rinsing her hair out now. It reminds me of nap time and bed time. I always still rock her to sleep at bed time, but for naps, she just understands it's nap time now and doesn't give me any hassle! When I say I don't have to be extra careful, I mean she's no longer worried about me rinsing off her head. She's used to it, so I can do it freely without having to distract her with any of the usual tricks like placing the letters on the walls, or putting them in my mouth and having her bite the other end, or throwing strings... the usual stuff. I just rinse her head and she lets me do it. Since I don't have to be as careful, I get to do a very thorough job! It's awesome. My smart little girl is growing up!

I get her dressed in pajamas her mother got her and we brush her teeth. Again, she's gotten good at letting me brush her teeth all in one go. She's so impressive. Finally we feed the pets and I take her into her bedroom for bed time.

* Bed Time

We get into her room a little earlier than usual. It's fine with me because cuddling her before bed is my favorite thing to do. When /Isn't She Lovely/ starts, of course her head collapses onto my chest. She isn't asleep when it finishes and I felt like singing to her so I also sing all the way through /Stand By Me/. Since I was singing, she participated a little and so is still not asleep. I cradle her when /Just The Two Of Us/ comes on and we listed to that all the way through before I lay her in her crib.

I'm so glad by the way you're growing, Noumena. I'm really impressed with you every day and it seems like every day there's something new you're picking up or understanding. I'm so excited for tomorrow and whatever it has in store for us!

Sweet dreams, my precious little girl. Daddy will always be here whenever you need him!

* Home

I left work just a little bit early so I could go see Noumena today. What's funny is that when I got to daycare to pick her up, before the gate to her classroom as opened, she just kind of eyed me down. The moment that gate was open, though, she ran into Daddy's arm. I greeted her as I always do telling her "Daddy missed you so much" repeatedly in a high pitched voice. Just as she was leaving she said "bye" to the daycare worker and it was absolutely so precious.

Noumena had such a meager dinner tonight. My initial plan was to give her a nap and then make dinner, but there was no way Noumena was going down for a nap. As I stood in the kitchen trying to figure out what to feed her, she pointed at the bread and started making noises. I couldn't resist giving her a piece.

I still wanted to figure out what to make for dinner as I sat on the couch and she was wondering around, but then from the kitchen I heard her making noises again. She wanted more bread and she was trying to reach for it! As meager as it sounds, I let her eat that bread and also gave her a cup of soy milk to drink with it. After that, I gave her some dates to eat.

I refilled her soy milk cup because she was asking for more, but she ended up playing with it more than anything else and spilled it all over herself. She soaked her shirt and her skirt. So I had to change her. I don't know what got into her---I don't know if it was the kids in daycare or what---but she decided to be a huge pain in the ass when I was changing her. I mean she has never been this deliberately defiant before. It's a long road ahead as a parent. That's for sure. Despite her best efforts---and believe me, she really did put her best efforts forth---I got her changed and we head outside to go to the park.

* Neighbor's House

As we exit our home, I saw Miss Theresa in the driveway. Of course I can't pass up the opportunity to visit with her, so Noumena and I go and sit on their chairs on the porch and we talk about all sorts of stuff just bullshitting with one another while Noumena spends most of her time trying to figure out these bubble things.

* Park

[[file:hiding-in-park.jpg]]

The first time we went to the park, we weren't able to stay long. Boy was Noumena mad about that. I swung her in the swing a little and our friend Caleb was there and he asked me to push him so I pushed him as well. But after that I noticed that Noumena had gone number 2... I thought about just letting her play, but I just couldn't do that given the diaper rash she had recently. We had to head home and believe me on the way home she let me know she was upset about having to leave already. In fact, Miss Theresa saw us coming back home and even commented on how short we'd been gone. I told her I had to change Noumena's diaper and Noumena and I promptly headed back to the park

* Before Bath Time

We stayed out pretty late tonight, but I was concerned that she hadn't eaten enough so I left enough time in getting back so I could give her a little porridge just to make sure she didn't go to bed hungry. After eating a little, I brought her on the bed to wrestle with her until bath time.

* Bath/Bed Time

Bath time is pretty easy going tonight so I'm grateful about that. She does wonderfully with me rinsing out her hair and I get her cleaned up pretty quickly. I did try to get her to use this toy submarine that sucks up water when you squeeze it and if there's water in it to spray it everywhere, but she couldn't quite grasp the concept that it contained water to be shot out.

I think brushing her teeth tonight was the easiest it's ever been. She let me clean both arches on the first pass through her mouth. I didn't have to try over and over again to get her teeth brushed. The trick of going into the hallway so she's not distracted by the mirror really works! We feed the pets and then settle in for bed.

As is typical of Noumena, she collapses onto my chest the moment the music comes on. She's gotten in the habit of singing to /Isn't She Lovely/ before bed and I absolutely love it. You can really tell she's trying to sing along and she just doesn't know the exact melody or words yet, but she'll get there soon. When she stops singing, that's when I know she's out for good. Nevertheless, I hold her and dance while /Stand By Me/ plays before finally laying her in her crib to sleep.

Noumena, I appreciate you testing the boundaries so much. Even though you were difficult and I felt kind of bad having to force you to stay still to the best of my ability in order to get your clothes on while you squirmed, I am really proud you're growing and your personality is beginning to shine through.

You are the most important thing I've ever experienced in my life, Noumena. I would give my life and limbs for you in a heartbeat and I don't ever want you to feel or think otherwise. You are the light in the darkness, for me, baby girl. My reason to live. Good night, sweet baby. I hope you have the best of dreams!

* Inexplicable

I wake up and I'm in a good mood. I slept more than 8 hours and Noumena made no disturbances all night. I thought she was asleep when I woke up and was super impressed that she has slept for over 11 hours. I would later remain impressed but for completely different reasons.

When I walked into Noumena's bedroom I'm bludgeoned by a wall of horrendous odor. Her bedsheets were covered in fluid (thank god for  the bed liner, seriously). She has awful diarrhea. They have a term for what I experienced aptly named "Diaper blowout" In some ways I was grateful for her onesie being on. I have no idea how much worse it could have been had it not contained a good amount of what was there.

Noumena sits up to greet me and is completely unphased. She's happy to see me. Now, I have no idea how long she was sitting in her own filth, but it seemed to me as though she could stay that way indefinitely. That she didn't wake me whenever this happened is truly incredible... Her mood quickly sours...

Normally, I give her some time to wake up. When she was an infant, I would change her diaper first thing in the morning. Since growing into a toddler, I set time aside in the morning to get her acclimated. We greet the owls and the Easter bunny, I feed her and let her play with Chalmers a little before putting her through the trauma of changing her diaper. Not today.

The first thing I do is go to clean her out... Oh man, this is hard. This is the gnarliest smell I've ever experienced. I have no idea how she was calm in this and for how long.

She hates it. Maybe because of the moisture, but she cries the whole time I'm changing her. We head straight for the bath tub. Normally, she loves the tub, but today she hates it. She cries the whole time I bathe her. I felt so horrible.

After bathing, Noumena and I eat and then she feels much better. I remove her bed liner and sheets, pick up her clothes and start the laundry with extra soap. I also take the trash I throw her diapers into out. The smell lingers in her room, so before we head to daycare, I open her windows. I tell them about her incident and they inform me that if she has diarrhea again, then I'll have to pick her up early from school.

Opening Noumena's windows turns out to be futile. Upon entering my home, a thick cloud of stink is awaiting. I head to CVS to get fabreeze and spray the whole house several times throughout the day.



* Day care

She looks like she had fun with the pipe cleaner and paper project they did today:

* Early Return Home

The daycare calls at about 2:30 telling me Noumena needs to be picked up due to having diarrhea. Honestly, I'm excited. Given the choice between working and hanging out with my daughter, I choose the latter a million times over. When I arrive at the daycare, she's seated at the cute little toddler tables pictured above eating mixed fruit in a bowl. When she sees me, she gets so excited she leaps out of her chair, screams, and does the best approximation of running a 13 month old can with her hands raised in the air around the table and towards me completely demolishing my heart in the process.

I've said I never want her to forget a day she doesn't want to, but I want this memory buried in the recesses of my mind for as long as I live. A true travesty is the fact that I will not imagine this moment every day in the future. That's how beautiful it felt to me.


* Food

Noumena was supposed to have goldfish with her mixed fruit and I guess she didn't get around to it, so they gave me the bag and I took it home with us. I can't help but be affectionate with her while she eats.

* Park part 1

When we arrive all the kids are there. They all run to greet Noumena as usual, but Yaya has become the most affectionate with her.

I put Noumena on the swing and Yaya swings her. I get jealous and I say she's my baby. Yaya disagrees. A battle ensues, but I think I got the upper hand!

It's truly remarkable how quickly they advance. It's recorded! Two days ago, she didn't even want to try to go down the slide by herself without Daddy hanging on. The day after that, she didn't put her leg in the correct position. Now look at her! Without hesitation, she gets into position---the correct position---and slides without any issues.

* Evening

Arriving home, of course both of us are parched. I give her some water and go to take a rest on the couch while I drink mine. She's still thirsty, so she comes to visit me. Since it's just water, I'm not worried about her spilling it whatsoever. I set the cup on the ground, and to my surprise she does it all by herself! Remember when I said every day feels like a milestone? It's so true!

Noumena is quite whiny today. She needs lots of attention. There's a small internal conflict with how I'm supposed to handle this. Obviously when things are important, I will leave her to self soothe even if she wants attention. But I think about the future. I know that one day, these days of her being this needy will be behind us and I will miss them. I envision me telling her one day, "Noumena, it used to be that all you wanted to do was spend time with Daddy." Because of this, if she's demanding attention, more often than not, I give it to her. This includes when I'm cooking. After all, she just wants to help Daddy cook the tofu scramble. Honestly, it's one of her favorites.

* Park part 2

Excitement wells up inside of me from the fact that she doesn't need me at all to help her go down the slides anymore. It's about 7:30pm and I just want to take her to the park to do it as much as she can. As we're leaving, Noumena sees Kisa and wants to be let down, so I let her. Unfortunately for the lizard, Kisa is having her way with it and removed its tail somehow. Poor lizard.

When we get there, Yaya and Ja arrive again shortly after. She's gotten so good at sliding, I'm far away. I don't even need to be close to her. She's so brave and her competence has greatly improved since yesterday.

Yaya is playing with Noumena at the bottom of the slide when Yaya says "I think she farted." Uh oh... I go to check and sure enough it's diarrhea again.  We cut our time short, say bye to Yaya and Ja and go home to take care of it.

* Bath time

I don't know if this morning's bath was a traumatizing experience, but she certainly did not want to take a bath this evening. She's whining, crying a little, but it's definitely manageable. I just hate it because I always want her to be having a good time. Distracting her by smacking her letters against the side of the tub seems to be working though, improving her mood slightly.

* A new songs to make me tear up

I'm not sure if this song is going to consistently make it into our just before bed playlist, but I did want to listen to it today. We listen to our usual Stevie Wonder song, but after that I pick The song /Just The Two Of Us/ by Grover Washington Jr. and Bill Withers. I feel so close to her and it really does feel like just the two of us in these moments.

I love you Noumena, good night! I hope you feel better for both our sakes.

* Wondering

These journal entries have been shared with a few friends and family since I've been posting them. What initially started out as me just wanting to make sure Noumena would never forget a day that had gone by if she didn't have to has started to create other motivations. As she grows, there will be those who she may want to draw from and appreciate these entries. There are others still who I want to be close to her. But when I consider these others, then I start thinking about writing.

I've noticed that I kind of start these journal entries with a hook. Something attention grabbing I feel. I didn't initially intend for it to be that way; that's just kind of how it shook out. Today's entry is no exception. Now I'm starting to identify with it. Isn't that weird? Thoughts creep in like, "this is just my style." Very strange. It comes with dread, too. For one thing, these entries are in some way about me now. I have a different kind of stake in them. I want them to be enjoyable to the reader whether that reader is Noumena or not. Then comes the dread. What if I don't have my signature introductory thoughts? What if I don't have anything to say?

We have hundreds maybe thousands of thoughts a day. I'm not sure, I've never counted. But the idea that some of them are just not worth sharing is strange. They are you. These thoughts compose everything of interest of you as a person. Isn't there something you're worth as a person each day?

Part of me knows this is true. That's why I want to do this every day. I don't want to be the arbiter of what moments in Noumena's life are important. Whether I can record the events tactfully and present them the right way is of concern, but the hightest concern is that they're recorded. It's because I want /her/ to decide what moments are important. I want /her/ to select and determine and save her favorite moments. I want it to build our relationship for years to come.

If I can't start every post with a banger, then so be it. It's still worth something to me, just in case it's worth something to her.

* Morning

Did Noumena wake me up at 7:30 am and I just didn't know it was in response to her noises, or did I wake up and then a couple minutes later hear her making sounds? I'm not sure. She seems content again this morning. Fantastic. I hear her, but she's not fussy so I read an article this morning. I read for about 20 minutes and she starts to fuss, so I go in her room to greet her.

She's in a wonderful mood this morning! The second I pull her up from the crib she does her signature grunt and points right at the owl pictures decorating her walls. She loves them. She loves touching the canvas and examining carefully as she traces her fingers along it with a smile. We turn around and on the opposite side of the room, there is an Easter bunny her mother put on the wall. She does the signature point and grunt again. So we walk over to the other side of the room and she does the same with with the Easter bunny that she did with the owls.

Time for breakfast. What!?! I ran out of oatmeal? That's right. I meant to get it at Walmart yesterday but they didn't have it. No matter, we have ground rice that will have to do for today. I'll walk with Noumena down the street to the grocery store and get some.

I stop by CVS to get an energy drink and drink it while in the store. I wanted to let her wander around and play. I set her first next to the toys section and she wanders from there. She's been quite taken with the beanie babies, so she heads over to them, but I know what will get her attention. I go and grab a miniature foam basketball. She loves it! I throw it to her and prompt her to throw it back, but she thinks it's 1 v 1, so she takes off! I have a trick though. If I run away, she follows. She's always so happy. We played in the store for maybe 20 minutes.

Since she was so good at following me in CVS, when we went to the grocery store I let her try to carry the oatmeal and was prompting her to follow me. For a while she did and of course it was the most adorable thing you'd ever seen, but she started wandering off again, so I had to catch her.

While trying to put away her cereal once back at home, she starts whining for it. I'm a sucker for this girl, so I make her some oatmeal. She eats and we play for a while before heading to the park.

At the park mom calls us and we set up time to visit her for dinner. We had such a busy morning, by the time we got back from the park it's a little past noon and she's so worn out, I put her down for a nap.


* Lunch

I'm a millenial, so it's expected that I make avocado toast. I give it to her also, but wait a minute. She's not a millenial. Is that even allowed?

* Kay's house
Noumena's babysitter recently had a double mastectomy, so we went there to check on her and see how she was doing.  Noumena remembered Kay's house and thought I was going to drop her off so she was so sad. When she realized I was staying she clinged onto me. She didn't want me to let her go at all. At one point I had to go move my car because I was blocking someone in, so I left her on the couch and said "Okay, bye bye. I'm leaving you forever I'll never see you again," and moved my car. My goodness, when I came back and she realized I wasn't going anywhere, she ran towards the door to grab me. She really is a daddy's girl.

We hang out there for about an hour and a half her son was watching the Sam Raimi Spider-man 3 so we finished that and started on this animated dog movie, which was really not very good. She got Noumena some new clothes and a headband we had to try on.

Kay had turned the thermostat up because the cold made her uncomfortable after her surgery so it was hot in there. It was also hot in the car because it was really hot outside today. I think the heat exhausted Noumena, because when we got home, she was falling asleep in the car seat. I set her down for a nap at 4pm and woke her up at 5pm.

* Dinner

We've got some time to kill before we meet mom for dinner. She's so independent now. She can occupy herself for so long with simple things like playing with this yellow chair.

We meet Mom for dinner. Mom buys her new shoes and I think this is the first time Noumena's ever had a lemon. I'm so happy I got the reactions on video.

* Evening


As tradition would mandate, we need to go to the park. It's about 6:30pm and I want to make sure she gets good and tired, so we take the long way to the park. I probably didn't need to because she was already tired. While I was carrying her, she was trying to fall asleep on my chest. We play for a little while, she goes down the slide, but now she doesn't want to go all by herself. That means she sits in sliding position at the top of the slide and grunts until daddy reaches out his hand for her to hold onto. It was so precious. We get home and my baby is so tired today even after taking 2 naps! She's practically falling asleep on me before her bath time.

* Bed time

There's nothing new to this story. I've been telling you she's been tired for a long time now. Do you think it was any effort at all to put her to bed? No. Just like yesterday, she was daddy's little angel.


As she grows and becomes more expressive, I really begin to feel more and more loved by her. How could it be possible to fall in love with the same little girl every day? She is just always happy and smiling and having a wonderful time. I just pray that there's something I can do to keep her this way. I want to raise her right so she can always feel this wonderful.

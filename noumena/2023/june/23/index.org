* Day with Daddy

I'm not allowed to bring Noumena to daycare due to her diarrhea which actually got worse today. It didn't affect her mood at all, but she sure didn't like the number of diaper changes today.

I was available all day at work even though I was watching Noumena which was really hard for me. She had to exercise as much independence as she could.

* Breakfast

We had oatmeal and applesauce with probiotics in it for breakfast. Usually, I let her eat by herself, but this morning I wanted to feed her so we ate together.

After breakfast I turn on the TV for her to be occupied which I hate doing, but I absolutely had to. It was hard to keep her distracted otherwise. And, although it made me proud that she wasn't that interested in TV, it also made it very difficult to continue to work at the same time she would cry or be needy.


She would lay next to daddy as he worked in a heart wrenching display:

She eventually ends up sleeping in near the same position.

* Lunch

Lunch was leftover tofu scramble and a bagel with strawberry violife vegan cream cheese.

Later on during the day, I moved to my office and worked from there allowing her to roam back and forth between her bedroom (which she made an absolute mess of) and my office.

Her room was not the only place she made a mess:

* Dinner

I have to think of something quick to feed her for dinner, so unfortunately we're doing pasta again. I don't have time to prepare much of a meal. She hangs out with me while I cook. I know Noumena's done with her pasta because at a certain point, she just starts throwing it on the ground. I give her a Medjool date to eat for desert.

Unfortunately, the demands from work are so intense, that I can't afford to watch her after the time I typically get off. I call my neighbor from across the street and ask if she can babysit for a couple hours while I finish up my work.

* Park

It's 8pm and I'm concerned about only getting to spend 30 minutes with my daughter before I have to give her a bath and otherwise put her to bed. Something that I realized, however is that I'm the adult. I make up the rules. I set the bed time. Tonight, she's going to bed late because I said so! I want to spend more time with her.

We had to the park but it rained really heavily today so we don't play on the playground much. This is fine with me because she's happy to play on the sidewalk. The sidewalk has uneven patches where the cement slabs have been shifted--raised and lowered--due to perturbation from the surrounding vegetation or soil erosion. Noumena views these fluctuations as an obstacle course, so she's happy to run up and down them. I of course chase after her wearing myself out just to hear her heartwarming laugh.

We take the long route home and end up at home about 9pm.

* Bath time

I think she's still a little hesitant from the traumatic bath experience yesterday morning, but she's better adapted than last night. You can tell she's not excited, but it's not too bad for her. I let her help me stick her foam letters to the walls of the tub in order to tilt her head back so I can wash the shampoo out. I thought she had figured that trick out, and I'm sure she has, but she seemed to not care this time which was a relief for me. She made it very easy to rinse her hair this evening.

* Bed time

We follow our usual routine only I get her to help me clean up her room that she made a mess of during the day when I couldn't monitor her as closely as I'd like to. After that we listen to music and I rock her to sleep. I'm saddened that I didn't get to spend as much time with her as usual today even though ostensibly I should have been able to spend more.

I love her so much, I just hope she sleeps wonderfully and am excited to see her tomorrow morning.

* They should be better than us

I recall a time when I was trying to teach my nephew Liam piano. He clearly wanted to learn because he was the one who asked me to teach him. Now, I'm no piano teacher. In fact, I'm not very good at piano at all. But I do know a few things and he was curious to learn some of what I could share. While I was attempting to show him a few things, he, frustrated with his own incompetence, began to cry. I attempted to reassure him. I would tell him no one can do what they want to do on an instrument when they first pick it up--that the most important thing is to simply try again--and, over time, he'll be able to do anything he wants. This was no consolation, however and he basically gave up right then and there.

Now, if it's not in his blood to play piano---as in a visceral desire---than I obviously had no interest in having him pursue it. The sad part is if he really did want to play piano, but felt limited by whatever it was that day that prevented him from coming back.

I'm reminded of this because today while Noumena and I were playing in the park, she attempted to leave. A few times I let he walk out the gate, but then would bring her right back. She wouldn't stop trying to leave. Then I thought about something an old friend of mine told me about children.

"Prohibition is the mother of curiosity."

Did Noumena want to leave because I was telling her she couldn't? If I had told my Nephew he wasn't allowed to play piano, would his curiosity have compelled him to disobey? If prohibition is the mother of curiosity, who's the Father?

I ask these questions knowing they're rhetorical. Obviously the first time Noumena bolted for the gate couldn't have been due to prohibition and maybe there was something over there she just wanted to investigate anyway. I don't actually think if I had told Liam he wasn't allowed to play piano he would have become a virtuoso. But, that's not the point.

The point is balance and that's something I'm not sure parents will ever fully crack the code to. I'm referring to the balancing the tensions between prohibition, structure, guidance and free exploration. And, crucially, this balance must be struck in order to maximize creative potential in any endeavor.

In some respects, my rigidity has stifled me. When I was staying with my friend Chris, I watched as he effortlessly decided what healthy dish to prepare that evening simply by glancing at what he had already had in the fridge. Oksana seems to have the same talent. What to prepare just occurs to her. While here, she prepared approximately 10 healthy plant-based dishes with ease and they were simple to replicate. She taught me a handful of them. Now, I can't cook without a regimen. I need a recipe. I need structure. I need steps and even then, sometimes I just can't do it as well.

What does this have to do with balance? Well, it's an extremely practical skill to have to be a good home cook. Invaluable you might say. It's a specific example where I want to foster an environment where Noumena is free to experiment, yet open to guidance, is aware when she needs structure and I need to know the right conditions to simply prohibit certain things.

I want Noumena to develop skills that allow her to feel free, but I never want to push her in a way that makes it feel like a burden---a chore---something to be avoided. I want to remove all the barriers she needs removed to progress like I would have in Liam's case and I want to erect both all the barriers that are needed to protect her and all the ones that she needs to knock down herself to progress.

I want Noumena to be better than me.


* Ante Meridiem

Seven thirty again? Is it something I'm feeding this kid? That's okay, if I don't get enough sleep that's on me.

I almost never change Noumena's diaper right when she wakes up for a few reasons. Firstly, if I keep her in her pajamas while I feed her and she makes a mess of them, I'm going to take them off to be washed anyway, so it makes cleanup a little simpler. Second, I always feed her first thing in the morning and... well let's just say it's no surprise what she does right after she eats first thing in the morning. Finally, she's also less fussy when changing her diaper if she's already eaten. Today, however, Noumena's diaper is soaking through and my arm is wet from just holding her. Yuck.

I change her and we heat up some of the porridge Oksana had made. For some reason, she wants to eat this independently so I just put the porridge on the spoon and allow her to feed herself. After breakfast, I set her down and use the restroom. As I said, to no one's surprise, I have to change her diaper again 5 minutes later.

We pack up and head to daycare.

* Daycare

The only photos I got from daycare today were of Noumena eating today's afternoon snack which was graham crackers and yogurt.

* Traffic, traffic, traffic

One of these days I'm going to learn that I should always check the GPS route before leaving to pick her up. As a matter of fact, I should probably check it in the morning as well, although I haven't encountered as many problems in the morning. As I'm driving to pick Noumena up, the Matthews Bridge, which is basically one of Jacksonville's arteries, is blocked off to traffic. I didn't know this until I had already committed to the expressway that leads to the bridge, so I get caught in the thick of it. Luckily, this has happened enough times I know a few tricks.

So I arrive late to pick Noumena up and when I get there she's the only one not in the first room where that's usually reserved for the big kids class. The daycare workers usually bring them all into that first room after they start funneling the kids out. I think it's easier to keep track of them when there are fewer. But she's not in there... She had wandered by herself to the back of the daycare.

I have concerns as I'm sure any parent would, but when I think about it objectively, I'm not really that concerned. My concern at first is "How could they not know where she is exactly?" But then I think that they have a lot of kids to keep track of, and everywhere is set up for children so it's safe. I also think about my own behavior. I've done my best to baby proof the house, so there are sometimes when she wanders and I don't have my eyes on her in my own home and I think I'm a fine parent, so who can blame them?

So, my little explorer is wandering. I love that she's curious enough to explore anyway. I sneak up on her and when she sees me she starts running the opposite direction. Today she wants me to chase her down! I'm, as usual, ecstatic to comply.

It's a rough car ride home due to the bridge being out in both directions. We listen to music the whole time but by the end of it Noumena is so over being in the car. We don't get home until 6pm.

* Back at the house

The first thing I always want to do when we get home is feed her. I'm grateful I don't have to cook anything since we had that leftover soup since Oksana was here. I heat that up for her, give her some soy milk with it and let her have a date as desert.

I'm wrestling with Chalmers while Noumena plays in her toy house, but because of all the commotion she has to come out and see what's going on. She takes some balls with her, and Chalmers is so hyped up now that when Noumena throws them he tries to pick them up. We played with her balls for a little while, and I'm not sure what prompted this today, but somehow we started playing hide and seek. I was the hider and she was the seeker. I first ran behind the brown dresser that sits against the wall across from the foot of my bed. She finds me there, so I jump up, scream and go hide behind the table in her room. Shortly thereafter, here comes Noumena to find me. The same thing transpires. I holler, she laughs, I run, she follows. Rinse and repeat throughout the house. It was a ton of fun.

I do some dishes while she's occupied with her toys and it's about 6:45 when we head to the park.

* Playground fun

When we get there, this guy there with his daughter has gray matching camo basketball shorts and a gray camo shirt. He's clearly copying me. Anyway, when I set Noumena down she heads straight for this soccer ball that these teenagers had left in the middle of the playground. Rival Dad's daughter is playing on the playground equipment but shortly comes up to greet Noumena. Noumena tosses the ball and Rival Dad's daughter picks it up and hands it to her. The first time was so cute, I saw it was about to happen again and I tried so hard to get video. I was only quick enough to snap a picture.

We begin to play on the equipment and I think she's brave enough to try the spiral slide all by herself. We're not quite there yet, so I go up to help her.

Her environmentalist streak has only strengthened since we were last at the park. So much so that she tries to clean independently now.

Our friend Katherine, and 8 year old girl, comes by and she's got her baby cousin Aiden with her because his mother is in the hospital. I wish them well and we play together a little bit. When Noumena attempts to leave the park, I jokingly blame Katherine. I ask Noumena, "Who told you you could leave? Was it Katherine", I say while pointing at Katherine knowing full well my pointing will prompt Noumena to point at her. It was definitely Katherine who told Noumena she could leave. When Noumena tries again, to get her to stay, I hoist her over my shoulder and run her around the park holding her arms outstretched as if she's flying. Noumena begins getting clingy, so she and I head out taking the long way back home.

It's about 8 o'clock when we get back to the house and I know Noumena's hot from playing at the playground, although the weather was pretty reasonable tonight, so I let her finish the glass of soy milk we had left behind before we left for the park and pour her a little more.

We sit and play for a little bit, but I had forgotten to take her shoes off. I always take her shoes off because I always want my shoes off for comfort and I imagine she feels the same. She likes to take her own socks off, so I loosen them a little and let her do the rest. To my surprise, she starts trying to put them back on! I have to get this on film...

* Bedtime routine

I want to make sure Noumena doesn't go to bed hungry, so I heat up a little more of that porridge at about 8:25pm and, the same as this morning, she only wants to eat it independently, so I place the porridge on the spoon and allow her to feed herself.

When Oksana was here, after her bath every night she would sing in Russian about things flying and landing on Noumena's head. Because it's so effective at keeping her attention, I starting singing the same thing. Works like a charm.

When we go to brush her teeth, she's become a pro. She barely even tries gnawing on the toothbrush anymore, she knows to let me bush all her teeth. It's going to be so exciting once she can do it herself!

Her falling asleep on Daddy's chest as we dance and listen to music together is a feeling I will never tire of.

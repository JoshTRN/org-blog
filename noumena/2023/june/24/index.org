* Morning


Noumena still has diarrhea this morning. I worry about her, but I keep her hydrated and her mood is always good so that makes me feel better.

We woke up at 7am, so there's a lot of time to kill. After breakfast, we head straight to the park.

When we get back home, I'm feeling somewhat lazy, so I take Noumena to hang out with me on the bed. Kisa is already sleeping on the bed. Noumena ends up loving on Kisa and it's the cutest thing you've ever seen. Kisa is so tolerant as well.

* Library

We meet mom at library for story time. The letter of the day is "C" and we learn the American Sign Language sign for community. Recently it's been really tough for Noumena to sit still in story time. She just has so much energy, so she wanders in an out of story time.

After story time, we go to the court yard with mom.

* Lunch

Noumena and I head out with mom to go meet her at the sushi restaurant that has tons of vegan options. Noumena tried every type of sushi we had and she loved it. I'm surprised she didn't get sick, however because I ended up getting food poisoning. That would be the last time I ate today.


* Home

I had been tired all day especially since Noumena had woken up earlier than usual and this sushi restaurant is 20 minutes away from home. I don't want her to fall asleep in the car since I want to nap while she naps, so every stop light I look back and smile at her and make a little scene to keep her awake. We make it all the way home without her falling asleep.

She goes down and it's about 1:30pm and so do I. She wakes up at 3pm waking me up as well. Oh no... I wish she had slept longer. The food poisoning is starting to kick in and I don't even know that's what I'm feeling yet. I just know I feel worse than when I went to bed.

* Evening

It had rained, so I wasn't going to take her to the park, but I still wanted to get her out of the house so I tried taking her for a walk. I felt so ill I was unable to go our usual long route. I cut it off half way through. Noumena had oatmeal, beans and these little puffs we bought from CVS for dinner. I obviously was not interested in eating at all. For most of the evening, she played independently with her toys while I monitored her.

I felt so bad, I felt like I had to sleep. I ended up putting her to bed 15 minutes early. She went to bed without a fuss, so she made it really easy on me, but I had a horrendous night.

I called Oksana and asked if she could help me with Noumena tomorrow since I felt so ill.

* Morning

I suppose I have to just accept the fact now that my babies internal clock will wake her up at 7:30am for the foreseeable future. I think she's used to that porridge now, so she doesn't need to eat it independently. I'm not sure what it is, but I enjoy keeping her on my lap and feeding her in the mornings. I think it initially started out as a practical thing, but honestly, it's just become something I bond with her over.

Today is water day at daycare, so I pack up an extra set of clothes, a towel, and her shoes and socks into a plastic bag, label it "Noumena" in sharpie and get her dressed in the swimsuit we bought the other day at Walmart.

* Daycare

We had a total breakthrough this morning when I dropped Noumena off at daycare. When we arrive, I wander around saying hi to all the younglings while she clutches my chest and shoulders. Maybe it's because she's familiar with the worker who handled her, but when I handed her over she didn't cry at all!!! Oh my god that's so exciting!!!

* Open Wide!

In accordance with our usual routine, once we get home, the first thing on the agenda is eating. As I warm our soup, it comes time for me to cut bread. I can't hold her and wield the knife at the same time, and she's always clingy when she gets back from daycare, so I set her on the stove while I cut the bread.

After everything is ready, I sit her in her high chair to eat. While she's eating I notice that she's really stretching her mouth as wide as it goes. It's so funny I have to get it on camera.

I give her two dates as dessert and let Chalmers help clean up any mess she made on her try.

* Playing at home
After food, I go to change her diaper, but after I'm done, I stand her up and start gnawing on her. When she leans her head back, I go for her neck.

I give her considerable freedom since there's nothing that can hurt her. Sadly, that means she gets into stuff that means making a huge mess! She waddles to the kitchen, opens the cabinet where I keep the tupperware and proceeds to strew it all over the kitchen floor.

I have no idea where Noumena learned this phone thing. I use a headset every time I use the phone. Her mother usually uses speaker phone to talk on the phone, so it's completely mysterious to me. Anyway, I notice her babbling and when she babbles I want to capture every second of it.

* Park

We go to the same park every day because the neighborhood kids are often there. Recently, though, this isn't the case, which saddens me. Having Noumena interact with other kids is honestly a highlight in my day. Oh well, I guess we'll have to make due with each other.

As is to be expected, her environmentalism continues to intensify.

* Back at home

At home, we listen to music and hang out.

Watching her develop is staggering. It really seems like there's something new every day. Her playing in a chair all by herself is just the cutest thing and I'm so impressed how once she learned to turn the light off, she appears to want that deliberately.

I need to get some of her laundry done, so I let her wander around with only a diaper on so I can clean the clothes she has on and it's right before bath time anyway.

I realized that I wanted to share how proud I was of my baby girl at how good she is at brushing her teeth, so I filmed it this time.

We follow our usual night time routine, although I think she associates the living room with activity now which is where we usually dance, so after /Isn't She Lovely/ I listen to /Stand By Me/ and /Just The Two Of Us/ in her bedroom where it's dark... She falls asleep on my chest and I lay her down for peaceful slumber.

Tomorrow is Saturday Noumena, so we get to spend AAAAALLLLLL day together, and it's the first day of July! I hope I can figure out something new and fun for us to do. I'm excited to see you in the morning. Sleep tight, my wonderful little munchkin!

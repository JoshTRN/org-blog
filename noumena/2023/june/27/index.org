* Morning

Noumena is awake and talking at 7:30am before I get out of bed. I come in making big noises right when I come in just to get her excited. She's in a great mood! For breakfast, we have oatmeal. I get her fed, change her diaper and then take her to daycare.

* Arriving at home

I'm so excited to pick Noumena up! When I arrive at daycare, she's in the main room, but she doesn't see me. I sneak up behind her, surprise her and she immediately gets up and runs towards me with her blanky that I let her take everywhere with her.

Every car ride we listen to music on the way home. Today was no different. On the way home we listened to /Neurotica/ by Polyphia and /Work Shit Out/ by Dirty Loops. By the end of the Dirty Loops song, she was falling asleep and was totally out by the time we arrived home. Carefully, I remove her from her car seat thinking she'll sleep for about a half hour before she eats. With her blanky draped across my shoulder, I carefully unbuckle her seat belt and remove her arms one by one gently so as not to startle her. She's a little shaken as I remove her but she rests her head against the blanket draped across my shoulder and I think I'll be able to put her down for a nap.

Noumena, intent on proving me wrong about napping, whines in her crib the whole time she's in there. Usually she'll fall asleep within 5 minutes as especially if she's seems tired and just fell asleep. Not today though. She whines the whole time. Eventually, I go in there to pick her up. I know she's not having a really hard time because she's excited to get out of the crib when I get in there and has a huge smile on her face.

* Dinner

I'm super excited to get Noumena to try vereniki. In english, we translate that to potato pierogies. Ever since I first had these, I fell in love with them they're so good. Oksana went to the international store and bought them along with some amazing bread today and made that for my lunch as well. I just love getting Noumena to try new foods.

Oksana also warmed the soup she made 2 days ago. Since the pierogies are so hot, and Noumena is really hungry, I offer her the soup first. This ends up being a mistake. Now all she wants to eat is the soup! Once the pierogies cool down, I give them to her, but she points at the soup and yells signifying she wants more!

What kid of mine doesn't like vereniki? I better get a DNA test!

We finish up dinner, and we're about to head out to the beach! We get ready, I give her a date to munch on while we're in the car and away we go!

* Day at Beach!!!

We drive Noumena to the beach which is about 30 minutes away from where we live. I'm actually grateful she didn't take a nap for a few reasons. Firstly, we get more time at the beach and arrive earlier. Second she gets to nap in the car, so she's not bored at all for the long car ride. Finally, she won't be tired or fussy at all when we get there.  We park only 1 block away from the beach and head there. We get Noumena covered with sun block and head to the water!

At some point during all of this joyous splendor, her happiness brings me to tears. I've never experienced a love like this before. That someone else' happiness is so important to you it can overwhelm your sensibilities is truly an unparalleled experience.

* Home


Back at home, I sit down with her to play with her blocks. She's very clingy, so if I just set her down right away she'll start crying. No, I have to let her do things independently first, /then/ I'm allowed to leave princess Noumena's presence.

While Noumena plays, I know she's going to be hungry from all that activity at the beach today, so I heat up some of that soup she loves so much! We eat that and dance to music while eating and until it's time for her to take a bath.

* Bath time

I suppose that ideally, I want to remember every moment with my daughter, but there are a select few moments that I want burned into my memory for eternity. I'm about to describe one.

Noumena doesn't want to take a bath, so she's a little fussy after I set her in the tub. She's standing and won't sit, so I sit her down into the water to make her more comfortable and start moving her toys to distract her. In preparation for shampoo, I wet her hair as she plays. I begin sudsing up my hands and Noumena starts paying attention to me. I place my hands on her head and start to massage the shampoo into her scalp.

#+begin_quote
/As I massage, she looks up, stares straight into my eyes with a mouth wide-open smile and holds my gaze with hers for seconds... seconds that feel like an eternity./
#+end_quote

Tears stream down my face as I wrote that last sentence and even as I return to it to proofread. That's a memory I never want to lose.

* Bed time

Oksana helps me change Noumena after bath time while getting ready for bed.

We dance to /Isn't She Lovely/ and I bring her into her room while /Stand By Me/ plays. She's still awake when /Stand By Me/ finishes, so /Just The Two Of Us/ comes on.

I have this amazing experience as I hold her close and continue to rocking her while listening to that song. As I rock her in my arms, held close to my chest it's as though I can feel my body connected to hers. I have such a strong emotional connection to her as I hold her close, periodically kissing her as I rock her that it almost feels like a physical connection like there's a tether running from my heart to hers that binds them together.

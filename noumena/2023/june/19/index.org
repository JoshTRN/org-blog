* Bath time

What!?! I'm sure you're thinking to yourself, "did I read that right?" Yep! It's already bath time.

Let's back up a little bit.

Noumena's sleeping great. I woke up at 8 and didn't hear her stirring at all. So I just lay in bed trying to fall back asleep until she wakes me up. It's not long, though, before I start hearing her making noises. Our cat Kisa is perched on the bed post at the foot of my bed annoyingly mewing just as Noumena is waking. So I grab the cat and head in there. I want to surprise Noumena by putting Kisa in her bed with her. When I get in I see Noumena scrunched on one side of the crib which is unusual. Then I notice in the center of her crib there's a large stain. At first I thought it was urine, so I thought maybe I had misapplied her diaper.  I still put Kisa in there and Noumena absolutely loved that. She really loves Kisa. Every time Noumena sees Kisa she makes loud yelps and shakes her hands up and down with a giant smile on her face.

As I pick Noumena up out of the crib, I noticed no smell of urine and her pajamas were dry. Then I saw her her hair on the right side of her head had hardened and still appeared wet as it was stuck together, chunks of whatever she had eaten still in there. Obviously she needed a bath. I removed her bed sheets, stripped her down, carried her with me to put them in the wash along with any of the other laundry that needed to be done and made her breakfast because I was concerned she needed to eat. We ate while she was still only clad in diaper. She ate all her food and drank a huge glass of soymilk without issue. She drank the soymilk like she'd been stuck in the Saraha desert. I attributed it to the fact that she had vomited. She must need fluids.

I put her into the tub. To say I was worried sick just a little while ago would be an understatement, but in the tub she ended up comforting me with the biggest smile in the world--the kind I've grown to expect to see from Noumena. I decided to just monitor her and see if she had any other problems otherwise I would just chalk it up to a fluke.

* Daddy's little Helper

I put her in a cute little outfit and despite what happened this morning she seemed totally fine. I had left laundry in the dryer last night, so I needed to get it done in order to dry the her bed liner sheets and blankets. Wouldn't you know it my little girl decided to help.

I want to go to CVS again this morning... I'm addicted to those energy drinks. It's okay though because I can make the excuse that the real reason is that I want to play with my daughter since that's what we always end up doing anyway. We exit the door, she sees Kisa and starts giving Daddy hell for holding onto her.

"Daddy, don't you know I want to see Kisa?"

I set her down on the porch while I lock the deadbolt and she rushes to Kisa. After locking the door, she comes and greets me by it. I stand at the step to our porch to allow her go down it herself. As she walks down the driveway towards the street, I follow closely behind. She slows, so I slow... She's not moving...

"Beep Beep. Get out the way." I walk around her. Now she's following me. Kisa then pounces into our front yard along side us. Noumena is side tracked and starts to chase her down. I let her stand and stare at Kisa in the front yard for a bit then I go to grab her hand. Usually when I grab her hand to lead her, she just kind of lets me do it with her hand limp in mine. She's says internally, "okay fine I'll go with you." This time it was different. For the first time I felt her hand intentionally grasp mine as though she knew I was going to lead her. She grabbed tightly and my internal organs turned to mush. It's these little things that I never want to forget and I hope there's some small chance she can re experience them as she grows.

Any time anyone sees her playing, it's almost as though you have X-Ray vision into their chests the way you can tell their hearts warm and eventually melt. It's hard to find anyone who's day isn't made just a little brighter by Noumena.

Later, we spend some time at the park, but it's really hot in Jacksonville in June. Even at 10:30 am it's sweltering. Sweat is dripping down my face. Last time she went down the slide by herself, she got a little hurt and a little scared... She's learned better now. Instead, she sits at the top of the slide and shrieks at Daddy until I help her down.

We're walking home and I attribute it to the heat or maybe to how she felt earlier, but Noumena's a little fussy trying to fall asleep on Daddy's chest.

* What a mess!

It's around 11am when we get back which is a little early for her nap time, but she's still fussy. We lay in for a while and her gaze is transfixed on the ceiling fan after I had called Chalmers to join us on the bed. I think she must just be tired, so I stroke her legs, arms, hands and face with a gentle touch--a touch that when I was a boy I had affectionately called "tickle-scratch" when my mother would do it to me as a boy.

[[file:laying-in-bed.jpg]]

After a while she starts fussing. Maybe she needs to rock? I pick her up and begin rocking her in the room.

"OH MY GOD!!!"

She projectile vomits all over her dress. My poor baby.

I change her outfit and call the pediatrician. They set me up an appointment for 1:15pm.


Okay, so now I'm worried about Noumena being dehydrated again. I go to give her soymilk again. This turns out to be really stupid, but she's downing it again like it's water in an Oasis. I'm loving and comforting her when all of a sudden she projectile vomits even more all over me.

Forgive the grainy picture, but I did capture a little of it.

She obviously doesn't want to eat, but after a little while she starts feeling better allowing me to mop up the mess in the hallway, but she starts fussing. She needs Daddy's love and comfort.

I almost never use the TV. I sort of object to it as brain rot and I want to avoid my kid's brain rotting as much as possible, but in this case I'll make an exception. We turn on sesame street and watch together, her sitting on Daddy's lap. It's 12:35pm now and has obviously had a hard day, so she falls asleep. I want to keep her awake because I know she's going to get cranky given that she's only going to be sleeping for about 25 minutes before I have to put her in the car to take her to the doctor.

I can't bear to disturb the kid though. She sleeps there on my chest until it's time to go.

* At the Pediatrician

At the pediatrician's office, we follow the nurse into room number 6 far in the back and to the right. The nurse weighs her and checks her vitals and everything seems normal. 18 lbs 12 oz. What she's losing weight? Last time she was 19 something pounds. This compounds my worry, but the nurse asks about whether she's walking. The nurse seems unconcerned and says that they lose weight once they start walking a lot. I guess I feel a little better... Noumena walks a lot. We walk every day. All the time. And she's always walking at day care. Later, her pediatrician Ms. Ashley never mentions her weight so I feel more comfortable.

Noumena can't stand Ms. Ashley with her stethoscope. She doesn't like any of this. I think maybe she remembers the pediatrician's office and how she got poked there before when she was vaccinated. Ms. Ashley checks Noumena's ears, throat, lungs, and listens to her digestive tract. Nothing seems amiss.

She starts talking about how Noumena is teething and can I just say this seems like it just makes no sense to me. Noumena is having her 15th and 16th tooth come in right now... You'd think if teething were the issue, I would have experienced this a little earlier maybe with her other molars. Anyway, there's no signs of infection and Ms. Ashley tells me that she can't rule out something viral but she doesn't think it's food poisoning because Noumena and I had eaten all the same food yesterday. She recommends a probiotic powder called Culturelle mixed in applesauce.

I guess I feel relieved, even though sometimes it's better for something to be obviously wrong because then you know the cause. We head to Publix to pick up supplies for Noumena.



* Afternoon

After we pick up the groceries from publix, she's tuckered. I have to use the restroom, so I set her down in her crib. She doesn't want to be in there, so she starts crying. It doesn't last long though. She's so tired that by the time I finish in the bathroom, she's out. I close her door and start writing about our day.

Noumena sleeps until about 4pm and she's grumpy when she wakes up. Cuddles don't soothe her, neither does rocking... I know what does though. I turn on Stevie Wonder and wouldn't you know it, she's content. It's time to try feeding her the applesauce with the probiotics we just bought. She took it well it well. I end up trying to feed her more than one and she gets through another half container before she's done with it. While feeding her I listen to /Stand By Me/ by Ben E. King and the lyrics are hitting different. I'm teary eyed.

I learned my lesson from the soymilk and switched to just filtered water. She's fine playing for a while which is good because it gives me a little time to tidy up.

At around 5:30 we go I perch her atop my shoulders and take her to the park. She's smiling at the barking dogs along the way.

I have to say I don't know who these savages are, but who breaks beer bottles in a park where little kids are playing? We don't stay long. She seems tired. I guess vomiting several times a day can really take it out of you.


* Evening

We played a lot with her blocks today and the hollowed out cube I had written about earlier with the various holes for the pegs to fit into. She's really getting better and the fine grained motor articulation. She also has a blue container you can see in the first photo of this journal entry filled with 10 blocks 2 of each shape: a star, circle, triangle, an X and a square. Those blocks become strewn all over the house along with her plastic rings that fit around a large peg.

Growing weary from those toys, she starts fussing again. I too feel a little stressed... I want an sugary Iced tea. I know, it's not the best, but it helps a little. We head off to CVS. There's a church adjacent to CVS, so when we leave I take her to the grassy patches of the church. She's in a great mood again. I love it. We hang out there for a little while and head back home.

At home, you can tell she's getting tired because she's cranky again. I'm texting while she's on my lap while we sit on the floor and that's unacceptable. She demands daddy's attention... Oooohhh... what am I gonna do with this kid for 30 minutes until her bath time? I actually know the /perfect/ thing to do with her. Instead of me waiting until she's asleep to pick up her toys... I make her do it! I'm brilliant! A genius I say! I get her to put all the wooden parts into the cube--all the blocks into her box--all the rings back on the peg.


I bathe her and afterward while we listen to /Isn't She Lovely/ she's falling asleep grasping my chest as I dance around the living room holding her.

/Stand By Me/ comes on autoplay as I take her to her room. It hits me so deeply emotionally this time as I stare into her gentle eyes as they slowly close and I'm singing the lyrics to her. Ironically I'm in tears. I say ironically because I'm crying as the lyrics say:

#+begin_quote
If the sky that we look upon

Should tumble and fall

Or the mountains should crumble to the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry

No I won't shed a tear

Just as long as you stand

Stand by me
#+end_quote


The lyric that hits me hardest and is causing my eyes to well with tears as I write this is:

#+begin_quote
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me

Oh, stand by me

Won't you stand by
#+end_quote

Because it captures exactly how I feel. I want her to always be able to stand by me whenever she's in trouble.

Noumena, stand by me.

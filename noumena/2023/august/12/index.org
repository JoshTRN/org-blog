* Morning

I slept all the way until 8:30am with the exception of waking up very briefly at 7am. Noumena slept phenomenally also. I can't even believe she didn't wake up, but it was good because I needed the sleep. She gets up right after I got up, though, so I take some time to prepare her breakfast, let Chalmers out and make myself coffee before going in to get her. She's in a wonderful mood when she gets up. She's talking and moving around the crib, but she doesn't want to stand. She wants Daddy to pick her up. I'm patient, however and I wait for her to stand before picking her up.

I can't remember what I went into the kitchen for, but I didn't have any reason I didn't want to be holding Noumena. She wanted to be held, but before I got the chance to pick her up, she started throwing a fit. I didn't start filming it until I saw her laying on the ground, not really crying, looking at me out of the sides of her eyes. That's when I knew she was just playing it up and it was so funny.

We ended up in Noumena's room some time after breakfast and while we're playing with her toys, Noumena's mother calls and says she's gotten us free entry to an event at a convention center called Unicorn World. She wants us to pick her up in 30 minutes so we leave in 20 minutes at about 10:40am.

* Unicorn World!

We drive to Unicorn World, wait in line after parking, and head into the convention center. The moment we can get out of line, we do and start looking for the Unicorns. The animatronic unicorns are really creepy. There are tons of kids there and Noumena absolutely loves it.

There's stuff for toddlers there too! We stop by the story time there, but Noumena definitely doesn't seem interested and so we head around to the toddler's bouncy castle and the ball pits.

There are so many videos I took while we were there, I thought they were too much to include in the blog so I organized a playlist of all the videos below.

* Back At Home

After Unicorn world, as we were headed back, the Burger King was on the way and I couldn't resist the fast food urge. I got an Impossible Whopper and some fries and hand Noumena fries as we drive home. Once home, we finish our lunch and spend time in the living room. Kisa isn't usually in the house during the day, but she happened to be today and was waiting to be let out. Noumena doesn't miss an opportunity to gently pet and even kiss Kisa.

Once it's 1pm, I know it's time to get Noumena to take a nap. I try to get her to go to sleep by rocking her and listening to music, but she's not having it. She's gotten to a point where it's easier to just lay her down for her nap than it is to rock her to sleep for naps. I lay her down and she ends up sleeping until 2:30pm.

After she gets up, I try to feed her some dragon fruit. I can't tell whether she likes it. Maybe she needs to try it when she's hungrier.

Tree Hill nature center closes at 4:30pm, and I want to take her there, so we leave at about 3:20pm which should give us an hour there.

* Tree Hill Nature Center

I initially was going to include only a few videos in the blog that I thought were highlights, but there were so many too good not to include. I took her right to the goats the moment we got there.

#+end_export

After seeing the goats, we head to the chickens. I wish the chickens had been out, but she still loves seeing them.

Noumena's first word was "owl" so it's so exciting to see her to get to see a real owl for the first time! I didn't even know there was one at Tree Hill, so this is the most pleasant surprise.

We then make our way to the pigs and Noumena has plenty of opportunities to pet them.

Noumena loves things like bridges, and there's a huge boardwalk there. On our way down there, Noumena hears the goats and starts mimicking there noises. It's one of the cutest things.

I set her down on the boardwalk and of course she goes crazy!

</div>
#+end_export

On the other side of the board walk, there's an amphitheater. At first I didn't intend to take her to the amphitheater, but when we were on the path there with all the vegetation, as Noumena was running around the mosquitoes were eating me alive. I thought there wouldn't be as many at the amphitheater and I was right. We spent about 15 minutes there before heading back.

When we were headed out, I saw the owl again, but it was much closer and moving around so I took Noumena in for a closer look. They fed the owl a mouse, so Noumena and I watch her eat it. The owl swallows the mouse whole!

#+end_export

We stayed there all the way until it closed at 4:30pm. I think I only didn't include 2 videos in the blog, but I do have the tree hill stuff organized into the following playlist.

* Home Again

Once home, we hang out for about an hour. She starts playing with a box that holds her one word per page books. I'm not sure why she starts trying this but she starts trying to get into it.

I think I can get Noumena to go to take another nap and I want her to be pleasant for the rest of the evening so I lay her down at about 5:40pm and she's asleep by 5:45pm. I wake her up at 6:15pm to spend the rest of the evening with me.

* Publix

I wanted to pick up some stuff to make soup for us tomorrow, so we head to Publix at about 7pm. We only needed a few things, so we're in and out quickly. I did get some unplanned things, though. I see nectarines and I know that Noumena loves those so we grab those. I also knew we needed more of her baby shampoo. I got a knew one that's specifically for before bed. I thought it might be nice to try it.

* Park

[[file:playing-with-leaves-on-slide.jpg]]

The park is on the way back from Publix and we have some time since it's only about 7:40pm, so we stop there for a little while. I didn't know we'd have so much fun there but today at the park was really awesome. Of course, she has to pick up all the trash before she starts playing, though.

* Bath Time

We left the park at 8:15pm since we were driving back, I knew we'd be back home by 8:20pm. Noumena and I hangout in the living room briefly before I take her to take a bath. I used that new shampoo I got but I think it's actually worse than the other shampoo. I do think it has a better smell to it, a more fragrant one, but when I go to rinse it out of Noumena's hair, I get a little in her eyes and she makes a bigger
fuss of it than usual. I'm also being really careful not to get any in her eyes as well, so I'm sure that this shampoo is just rougher than the other one.

Noumena's in a great mood when I get her dressed in her pajamas and so talkative. She's been really talkative lately and I absolutely love it. I'm going to be so excited when she starts saying full sentences and expressing ideas. We head to the bathroom to brush her teeth and it's easier than yesterday. But this time, she's staring and pointing and smiling at herself in the mirror. I'm pretty sure she recognizes herself in the  mirror now. I may try doing the dot test soon.


* Bed Time

The pet's didn't eat much last night so their dishes are full of food and water. Noumena and I don't need to feed them, so I just take the music into her room with me.

We dance to our playlist and she falls asleep on my chest. I kept her there a little longer than usual because I was just so in love with her. I loved getting to take her to have amazing new experiences. I hold her tightly and kiss her. After /Just The Two Of Us/ finishes playing, I laid her in her crib. I thought for certain she'd be totally out of it, but I must have disturbed her a little when laying her down. She cries a little just before going to sleep.

My poor baby.


Noumena, I had so much fun with you today. We have a fun day planned tomorrow too! I hope you had fun and you got to see your favorite animal today!

I love you, baby. Please sleep well and I'll dream about you.

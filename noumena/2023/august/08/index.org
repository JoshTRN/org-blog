* Good Morning, Noumena!

Today was another oatmeal with blueberries and bananas day, although the blueberries taste kind of weird. I'm sure they're fine; I buy them frozen. But they do taste a little more sour than usual. Maybe they were prematurely picked, I don't know. What's good about that is that I make it the night before, so it's ready to go right when you wake up. Noumena wakes up at right around 7:45am this morning. I have an alarm set for 7:50am, so I close my eyes and wait for it to go off. She's very patient in her room in the mornings, so it's fine. I'm very proud of her for being that patient. You would think she would need some stimulus or something, but when I come in there, she's awake and just fine. No whining or crying or anything. Just ready to get the day started. Of course the first thing she does as I lift her out of her crib is point to the owls hanging on her wall and say "owl". Instead of me having to remember to say good morning to the owls, now she does it every morning.

The first thing after leaving her room, I give her ibuprofen just in case and her antibiotic she was prescribed Sunday. We eat breakfast, but since it's oatmeal it takes a little longer than usual. It's a bit thicker than the porridge so she washes it down with soymilk, but she's also eating slower than usual regardless. I attribute it to her sickness. In any case, we have to leave right after breakfast, so I get her dressed and we head out. When we arrive at daycare, I hand her straight to the daycare worker and she doesn't even care that Daddy's leaving. My little girl is growing up!

* Picking Noumena up From Daycare

She's definitely not in tip top shape when I arrive. Firstly, she stays seated and she's whining a little bit until I grab her. I have the perfect thing to cheer her up. As we exit the building, I spin her around holding her in my arms. A huge smile befalls her face and so I do it again, this time with her leaned back away from me, legs wrapped around my torso, my left hand embracing her head and by right arm embracing her back. Now she's in a good mood. When we get to the car, as I get the car seat ready to set her in, she leans her head across my shoulder. These moments of affection melt me every single time. I pause, standing in between the open car door and the car just enjoying the love I feel from Noumena and loving her back.

* (Not So) Relaxing at Home

Noumena had just fallen asleep when we arrived, so instead of eating dinner right away, I thought I'd set her down for a nap. I laid her in her crib, but she didn't fall asleep in 5 minutes, so I picked her right back out. I'm glad for two reasons: One, I get to spend more time with her, and two, she'll be really tired at bed time. I had made porridge just before leaving to pick Noumena up so it would be ready when I got home.  When I get her out of her crib, I make a big bowl of porridge for me and her to eat together. She eats okay, but she definitely has other stuff she wants to do, so before I finish eating, we go and sit together in the living room and start messing around. I give her ibuprofen just in case she ends up not feeling well before setting her down, however.

Her running around prompts me to turn this into a game of hide and seek and it is just the most fun.

I decide to cycle some of her toys. I might go to the consignment shop and pick out some new ones this weekend as well, because giving her these unfamiliar toys, she really enjoyed playing with them.

We hung out at home for a long time. We don't leave for the park until about 7:30pm.

* Park

When we get to the park, Brian is playing there with his older brothers. His older brothers are playing soccer and eventually they start kicking it over to Noumena. For about 5 minutes, Noumena tosses the ball back and forth with the boy and it's so cute. First, she starts of trying to carry it. She never gets around to trying to kick it, but she does realize that we're rolling it, so she rolls it with her hands.

There's a philosophy reference that got popularized with some of the people I talk to occasionally about evidence. The idea is that evidence is a weak notion in the sense that it's sort of easy to come up with hypotheses to explain some datum. One illustration we use for this is called the "shoe stealing fairy" hypothesis. If you wake up and find your she's disappeared, that's expected on the hypothesis that there exist shoe stealing fairies. Anyway, I think I found one!

One of the cool things that she learned is that she can control her speed on the slide.

It's about 8pm and her bath time is soon, so reluctantly we have to head back.


* Just Before Bath

When we get home, there's time to spare, so we chill in the living room and I notice her putting the blocks in the truck I had just gotten out. To my surprise, she gets the hexagonal block in the correct hole! I didn't know she could do this! I start filming right away.

* Bath Time
[[file:baby-butt.jpg]]

I usually start the faucet in the bath tub before getting her undressed, but I had a brain fart today and got her naked before taking her to the bath. Today, I wet her hair a new way. The toys she has (the ones that she uses as cups to drink the bathwater... maybe how she got sick. yuck!) are like little cups with holes in the bottom. I scoop water into the cups and as she plays with the faucet filling the tub, I hold the cup over her head as the water leaks out the bottom. I'm surprised she's not that bothered at all. I try to do the same technique when rinsing her hair, but this turns out to be a bad idea. I think maybe she got a little soap in her eye because she started crying. It didn't last but a few seconds, though, and I resolved not to do that again even though it is a really efficient way of rinsing out her hair. Maybe I'll try the baptism method next ðŸ˜‚. I prompt her to put the foam letters on the wall so I can wash her body down and when she does, I can't help but snap a picture of her cute little baby butt.

I don't know what got into her, but when I go to change her into her pajamas, she's making this straining face she makes from time to time. It's so cute and I have no idea why she does it, but she's done it ever since she was sitting up straight so probably since she was about 4 months old. Anyway, she's going ham on that face tonight, so I have to get a video.

I pull Noumena off of the changing table and she immediately points to the owls---naturally to say goodnight. I brush he hair and take her over there. I notice that she keeps smiling while I point at the owls, so I turn the video on once again because I'll never get enough hours of video of that amazing smile.

When I go to brush he teeth, she's trying to get out of my arms and pointing at stuff on the counter. She had a pair of sunglasses there, so I assumed that she wanted them, so I picked them up and put them on her face. This was a whole lot of fun.

* Bed time

We were having so much fun right before bed, I ended up putting Noumena to bed a little late. You could tell she was having lots of fun too because I don't think she wanted to go to bed either. I got tired of YouTube not recommending the right playlist and me having to fumble around on my phone trying to type in the songs one after the other at bed time, so last night I downloaded all the music and put it into Noumena's bedtime playlist.

I got the longer version of /Just The Two Of Us/ on it which is the last song in the play list. We first listen to /Isn't She Lovely/ and Noumena doesn't fall asleep to that. We get through /Stand By Me/ and she's just falling asleep, but by the time we get through /Just The Two Of Us/ she's passed out harder than usual. She is totally out of it. That means that she's going to sleep well tonight. She seemed to feel a lot better today in general, so my thinking is that she won't have a fever at all in the morning.

I love you Noumena! I had so much fun with you today I can't wait to do it again tomorrow!

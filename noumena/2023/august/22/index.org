* Morning

I woke Noumena up for breakfast and changed her diaper. She was completely parched. Her fever is making her extremely thirsty. I'm grateful she's drinking so well. Her body really needs all the fluids being used up by her fever. She eats a few bites of breakfast with me but not a whole lot. After I get her hydrated and fed, the only way she's comfortable is laying on my chest. I let her lay with me until she falls asleep on my chest before bringing her into her bedroom and laying her down in her crib. She's staying home again with me today.

* Day Time

Noumena sleeps so much during the day it's incredible. I check on her every hour during the day to make sure her fever isn't spiking and to make sure she doesn't need anything. I wake her up to eat lunch with me and she doesn't seem really interested in the same black bean soup that she was interested in yesterday. I'm eating buttered bread with it, and Noumena likes eating that with me.

The doctor told me not to give her fever medicine if her fever was below 101, but it reached 101 so I decided to give her some. Thankfully she took it without issue.

After lunch, I took a nap with her. She slept for a long time on the bed with me next to me while I worked on my laptop. I awoke her again to rehydrate her at about 2:30pm and we stayed up for an hour together, but she was not having fun.

* Evening

I let Noumena sleep all the way until 6:30pm. Honestly, I'm surprised she slept so long. Even when I went in to wake her up, it was difficult to wake her. The ibuprofen had really done its job though and she didn't have a fever. Moreover, she was also in a good mood. After getting her hydrated, I try getting her to eat more of the black bean soup. She's not really interested, but she is interested in feeding it to Chalmers. Again, what she's interested in is the buttered bread and at this point I don't really care what she eats just so long as she's getting some calories.

We hang out for about a half hour before going on a walk.

* Walk

I wasn't going to take her to the park because I didn't put her shoes on, but as I walked she seemed like she was well enough to go. I went a bit of a longer way to get to the park and the moment we arrived she didn't want down. That's good. I want her to take it easy and I wasn't suspecting that she'd like to move around. I was just taking her there in case she did. We go down the slide a few times together before heading back home. On the way home, we see our friend Harley, a neighborhood dog.

* Bath Time

Right when we get home she's of course thirsty even though she had been falling asleep on my chest on our way home. I sit down in the living room and she stands, walks to the table and attempts to grab her pink cup full of soy milk that was rested there. I give her some, but then she's off into the living room to read her books. She does my favorite run to get there. I read her a few books and at some point she grabs Daddy's hand and leads me to her other owl books.

I decided that I would give her a bath early because I thought it might take longer and she wouldn't like it. She had gotten the butter from the bread in her hair at dinner so I wanted to clean her. I was super gentle with her in the bath and I didn't even clean her well. In fact, I didn't even shampoo her hair. She was complaining when I was dampening her hair, so I knew I couldn't risk shampooing it. She calmed down a little so I did wash her just a bit, but she was ready to get out right away.

* Before Bed

I dress Noumena in these cute new pajamas right before bed and we hang out in the living room before it's time to brush her teeth and say good night.

* Bed Time

Surprisingly, right when I turn on /Isn't She Lovely/ Noumena's head collapses into my chest. I can't believe Noumena slept for probably about 9 hours in total today and is still tired enough to go to sleep. I only get through /Stand By Me/ before she's out cold and I lay her down for a good nights rest.

Noumena, even though we spent time together, I still missed you today. It was nice napping with you but I like it more when you're awake. Really, truly after I put you to bed I just kept thinking about you and missing you so much. I hope you feel better tomorrow so we can have more fun together. Of course we'll take it easy because it's going to be a while before you're 100%, but I just want you to have fun with Daddy.

Good night, sweet girl. Feel better!

* Waking Up

I don't get out of bed until 8:30am. Noumena let me sleep in, but I think she was awake since 8am. I prepare her porridge and my coffee before I head in to get her. She's excited to see me this morning and I'm excited to see her, but when I come in to pick her up she's on fire! I didn't get a chance to check her temperature, but she doesn't like the thermometer. She won't keep it against her head long enough for me to take her temperature and I'm not about to force her to do it. I'm thinking it's from the vaccinations she got last Monday, though I don't know. Fever is a symptom of some of the vaccines she gets, but it seems like usually they're sooner than 5 days later. I'm not sure. In any case, I give her the rest of the children ibuprofen I have. After a little while, she's much better.

Since I used every last drop of children's ibuprofen I had, so we have to go get some. I take her to CVS with me and we see geese along the way. I don't want Noumena to give me a hard time in the store, so I wait until we have already purchased her medicine. When we're headed back home, I let her down to chase after the geese.

* Headed To Library

When we go to meet her mom for story time, she's fallen asleep in the car. She had only been awake for 2 hours, so I was surprised she went to sleep, but I guess it's not totally surprising given she's sick. I see mom in front of the library and honk at her to come to the window telling her that since Noumena's sick I don't want to wake her up. She says we meet up another time and so we head back home. Noumena slept the entire way to the house, but wakes up just as we get there.


* Hanging at Home

I feed her some puree, apples and tomatoes because I'm pretty well out of food.

It's past 1pm which is her usual nap time, but since she slept in the car for about 20 minutes, she doesn't want to go to sleep. I figure the best way to get her to take a nap will be to wear her out at the park, so that's what I do.

* Park

On our way to the park, Noumena has become fascinated with the leaves on the trees, so I stop semi frequently to let her investigate them.

* Back at Home

We get back and hang out at in her room for a little while playing with her toys.

After a while, she does appear to be getting tired, so I try rocking her to sleep. She doesn't want to be rocked, so I lay her into her crib. She doesn't like it at first, but she gets tired really quickly and falls asleep in less than a minute at about 2:30pm.


* Nap

I let her sleep until 5pm. When I wake her up, she's fussy as I'm carrying her around. I try to give her soymilk and she doesn't care for it. I tried to feed her and she didn't care for it.  When I take her to the living room and start playing with her, she grabs her blanket and lies right back down. I decide to take her to her crib and let her go back to sleep.

I come back in at 6pm and she's out cold. I say her name and she wakes up enough for her to open her eyes and acknowledge me, but she immediately closes her eyes again. Even as I caress her head and back, she remains sleeping. I just don't have the heart to wake her up so I allow her to sleep even longer.

* Different Park

It's 6:30pm when I finally decide she's slept too much even though I feel bad about waking her up. I think that there's no way since I let her sleep so much that she'll go to bed on time unless I wear her out. I take her to the park a little farther away so that she can get really tired. I get Noumena's water bottle ready because I expect that she'll need it after she plays hard, and as we're leaving we see Kisa in the yard, so I let Noumena down to play with her. For the most part, Kisa and Noumena are very friendly with each other. Eventually, however, Kisa does get tired of Noumena getting into her space and snaps at her a little. Noumena wasn't hurt at all, and it didn't even stop her from chasing Kisa back down, so I'm not too worried about it.

We play for about 30 minutes at the park but then Noumena soiled her diaper. I didn't bring diapers, so we have to leave. I didn't feel great about it because I didn't think she'd be worn out enough, but I have to take care of her. When we get home, I change her diaper and when we're done we head back to the park that's close. I'm really adamant about wearing her out. She doesn't want me to let her go while she's at the park and again it's understandable since she's sick, so I take her down the slide a few times and run around with her in my arms before taking her back home.

* Home and Bath Time

Once we're back home, that ibuprofen has taken full effect. We read books together and get through a few but soon enough she's running around, screaming, hugging on Chalmers and annoying him just as she usually does. I take her to bath time a little late because I'm worried she won't want to go to bed on time. She absolutely can't stand the bath tonight. I remember this happened last time she had a fever too. Maybe it's just unpleasant to be in the water when she feels this way. Anyway, I wash her up quick since she clearly doesn't like it and she cries the whole time I'm trying to put on her diaper. Once I get her up from the changing table however, she's fine, so I take her to the bathroom to brush her teeth.

* Bed Time

I did think it would be an issue getting her to go to sleep, but she's actually very ready to go to bed. It's got to be because she's sick. Everything I read online said the fever symptoms should only last 48-72 hours if she did get it from the vaccine, so I hope she's better tomorrow. I don't know. I'm  not sure what to think. If she's not better tomorrow, I'll probably have to take her to urgent care to get her checked out.

I'm sorry you don't feel good baby girl. I'll do everything I can to make you feel better. Sleep tight, sweety.

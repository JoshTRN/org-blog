* Morning

Unfortunately, I have to resort to instant oatmeal again. Of course, Noumena doesn't mind at all. I wake up and get it ready before entering her room to wake her up. When I changed her diaper this morning, her rash had gotten a little better, so I was happy about that. She was much better changing her diaper than yesterday. We get dressed in her purple outfit and head to daycare.

* Picking up Noumena

When I arrive at Noumena's daycare and get to her classroom, all the children in her class are huddled up next to the teacher watching something on the tablet she has in front of her. When Noumena sees me, she gets up and runs to me. I missed her so much, I'm so happy to see her! When I get her into the car, within 5 minutes she falls asleep. Normally, she groans lightly for a little while before falling asleep, but today there was no groaning. She fell asleep immediately. Come to think of it, I didn't get any notifications from the daycare today except saying that due to the incoming hurricane, they're going to be shut down until Thursday, so I don't know how long she napped.

She doesn't even wake as I'm pulling her out of her car seat. I draped her blanked over my left shoulder, picked her up out of her car seat and she immediately rested her head against the blanket. I carried her all the way to her room and she barely moved. She whined a little as I set her into her crib, but she was asleep mere moments later.

This is good because it gives me opportunity to make porridge for dinner and tomorrow morning.

* Park

I feed Noumena immediately when she gets up at around 6:30pm and without wasting any moment we head to the park. There are a ton of kids of varying ages there when we get to the park seemingly all one family. The youngest was younger than Noumena having just turned a year old his mother told me. Then there were a couple of girls who looked to be between 3-5, and a boy aged 10 perhaps and a teenage girl maybe 15-16.

Noumena was entranced from the moment we got there. She's a really heavy people watcher around people she's unfamiliar with. They're taking up the swings and their mom asks if Noumena wants to swing and gets one of the girls to give up her swing for Noumena. Noumena swings with the other toddler, staring at him and his father the entire time.

Eventually, we get off the swing and head onto the playground. She wants to follow the other kids up the platforms, but she spends a lot of time just watching them. She ends up on the stairs surrounded the bars on the playground where she spends most of her time. At which time our old friends Caleb and Brailey arrive. Caleb comes and says hi to Noumena, and then goes to play with the person he came with.

We get off the platforms and then Brailey asks me to spin her around. I asked if she wanted me to spin her by her arms or her legs. Brailey is confused about the suggestion, so I demonstrate spinning around Noumena by the legs. I really just needed an excuse to spin Noumena around by her legs because she likes it so much. We settle on spinning by the arms because that's easier. I spin her while Noumena watches. When Caleb sees, he wants spun as well. I spin him and then Brailey asks to be pushed on the swing. Caleb sees that and wants to be swung as well. I swing them both.

Everyone else leaves, so we do also.

Noumena was in a bad mood all the way on the walk home. When we got there, I could see why. Her diaper rash had flared up again and it's so horrible causing her this pain while changing her poopy diaper. After changing her and holding her she calms down a little. When I take her to the living room, she points at the bread, so I give her some.

She's much happier while she's eating and is having tons of fun teasing Chalmers with the bread.

* Bed Time

Because of her diaper rash, I decided not to give her a bath tonight. I didn't want to irritate it any more than it already was. So instead we just play until it's time to change her into her pajamas. I put on a fresh diaper and a fresh coat of the diaper rash cream before dressing her in her pajamas.

We head to the bathroom to brush her teeth and she's so resistant. I get a few brush strokes in, but she's really fighting it tonight. Not sure why. I wonder when this is going to stop. We feed the pets and head into her bedroom, turn off the lights and start listening to /Isn't She Lovely/.

As usual, her head collapses onto my shoulder the moment the lights are out. We only get through one song of the playlist before I lay her down she's so tired.


Good night, Noumena. I hope your rash gets better tomorrow. I'm going to try vaseline to see if that will help protect you.

I love you so much, my beautiful baby. See you in the morning.

* Morning

I slept so hard yesterday it was crazy. Noumena didn't disturb me at all and in fact I didn't get her out of bed until 8:15am. I woke up a 7:55am, but took my time getting ready and getting Noumena's breakfast ready.

* Early Pickup

The air conditioning went out while Noumena was at daycare so they sent a message to the monitoring app to come pick up the children. I can't imagine what those with less flexible jobs than me do when stuff like this happens. It's truly scary to think how if I were a factory worker or something this sort of thing might be intolerable.

When I pick Noumena up, she's in such a wonderful mood. Much better than when I usually pick her up in the evening. I'm happy to see her, but it makes me feel worse about taking her to daycare all the time. I'm jealous in a way. When I pick her up usually, it's been 4 hours since she slept usually and often 3 since she's eaten. Sometimes I can't let her sleep because she doesn't go to sleep in the car or she doesn't get tired until it's too late to let her sleep, so she's often cranky. I'm jealous because the daycare workers get to see the best of her more often than not and I have to see the worst. Granted, the worst with Noumena is amazing. She's a wonderful daughter, but it just doesn't feel right that I'm not economically secure enough to raise my child myself at home and take care of her.

* Working At Home

When I get home, I still have to work for a little while. Since Noumena is in such a good mood, she is pretty well occupied while I'm in the room working. She tries to play drums for a little while and goes in and out of her room grabbing toys and bringing them about. This gives me enough time to finish what needs to be done at work. Noumena even hops on the call with my coworker and waves to him when he says hi. She's gotten really good at greetings and goodbyes lately.


* Playing At Home

I brought her into her room to change her diaper, and as we walk in, she sees the owls and wants to say hi to them. After she has a fresh diaper on, we sit down to play with her stuffed animals. She has a pink elephant Oksana got her a long time ago and I start making elephant noises. The noises initially scare her and I think it's funny, so I start filming it.

I don't want her to always play with the same toys, so I let her in the garage to decide what she wants to play with. I get out her caterpillar tent to play with. We also get out the balls, but I try to get her to say ball before I give them to her. I've seen her try and say it quite a few times, so I know she knows it, but I guess she doesn't want to right now. She never wants to say it when I try to get it on camera.

* Lunch

I lay Noumena down for bed at 12pm and lay down myself. I nap for about 30 minutes before getting up, but just lounge in bed for another 30 minutes after that. I have to make Noumena lunch and since she's sleeping it's the perfect opportunity. I wasn't sure what to cook, but I had tofu so I made tofu scramble again. It's a very easy, healthy, quick, go-to meal.

* More Playing

We play for another 2 hours at home. I was ambivalent about going outside because it was midday and hot, but I also wanted to take Noumena somewhere to have fun.

After playing for a couple hours, I remember this Tree Hill nature center we have a membership to. I can't find the membership card, but decide to go anyway. Unfortunately, it's passed 4pm when I decide to do this and it closes at 4:30pm. When we get there, it closes in 5 minutes. They want you to check in at the front desk, but I don't even bother as we're only going to be there for 5 minutes maximum anyway. The goats are all put away and so are the chickens. I hear a guy talking to the pigs, so we go see what they're up to. The pigs are being very noisy and Noumena is super intrigued by them. We watch them for a bit and then go and look at the chickens. Even though the chickens are in their coop, you can still very clearly see them. Noumena loves animals, so I'm going to take her there tomorrow before they close so she can spend more time looking at them.

Once we get back home, we hang out a little bit, but Noumena starts getting fussy. She's only been awake three hours, but she did take a short nap, so I'm thinking she can go down for another one. I wasn't wrong. I put Noumena in her crib and she cries a little but goes to sleep within a few minutes. I slept too and I slept hard for an hour. Crazy how I was so tired today. I woke up at 6:20 pm and was going to wake Noumena up at 6:30pm so I had 10 minutes to make dinner before she got up! I made bow tie pasta with green beans and garlic toast for dinner.

* Dinner

While Noumena is eating, she's in a wonderful mood. I wish I could swing stuff like this all the time. It was just great moods all day today.

* Evening

It started raining really hard during dinner, so I didn't think I'd get the opportunity to take her to the park. I wasn't sure what to do, so we just hung out in the living room for a while and I read her a few of her books.

7:30pm comes around and the weather has cleared up entirely. I know she's going to get wet if I take her to the park, but I think it's so close to her bed time and I'm just going to change her soon anyway, so we might as well go make a mess!

* Park

When we get to the park, the only thing she's really interested in is playing in the puddles!

We spend the majority of the time in the puddles, but we do eventually go on the play ground equipment. I even get Noumena to go down the wet slide. I thought the water would act more like an adhesive, but it was the opposite. Noumena bolted down that slide! I think it's the fastest she's ever gone!

I still want her to be worn out for bed, so I start running around the park prompting her to chase me. I get her traveling a good amount, so I'm happy with that.

We leave the park at about 8:10pm. As we're walking home, I'm still a little worried that Noumena didn't exert herself enough, so I set her down on the ground and turn a game into running home. I grab her by the hand and run a couple blocks with her. I tried to slow to a walk, but if she wasn't running, she wanted to walk independently without holding Daddy's hand, so I had to keep a very light jog to keep her interested. We ran for quite a little bit, so I think that will contribute to her being tired.

* Back Home Just Before Bath Time

When Noumena and I get home, there's only 10 minutes before it's time to get into the bath, so I sit down to read her books. I do the books because she's super interested in them and she doesn't feel like I'm abandoning her, which I think she tends to think when I just set her down.

* Bath/Bed Time

We get into the bath late, so we get out of the bath late. It's okay though, since I think she can go to bed a bit later because she napped so much today. It's already 8:55pm when I finish brushing her teeth, so we don't even feed the pets together. I just take her right into her room to lull her to sleep.

We dance to /Isn't She Lovely/ and she's still awake after that. By the end of /Stand By Me/, she's asleep. I listen to the whole of /Just The Two Of Us/ just to be sure she's in a deep sleep. I was wrong, though. she was asleep but it was a light sleep.

Noumena begins to cry as I leave her in her crib. She even cries harder than usual. My poor baby. I don't go back in there though because she doesn't cry for 5 minutes and going in there would just make it less likely that she goes to sleep sooner, but I really don't like letting her cry. Eventually, she falls asleep.

We had so much fun today Noumena! I loved getting to spend more time with you than usual. I'm going to take you to the nature center tomorrow to see the animals!

I love you, baby! Good night!

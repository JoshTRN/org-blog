* Good Morning, Noumena!

My morning alarm rang at 7:55am awakening me. I had slept soundly until that moment, hitting the snooze button twice before finally rising at 8:05am. Since I now have coffee creamer, I prepare myself a cup as well as a generous bowl of porridge meant to be shared between me and Noumena. She isn't awake yet. She slept as soundly as I did. I set out to prove what amazing sleep habits she has, so, filming as I enter her room, I stand over her crib and watch her sleep briefly before the clatter of Chalmers' nails against the linoleum hardwood floor gently awakens Noumena.

Kisa slept in the house and upon finishing our porridge, Noumena endeavors to greet Kisa good morning, who is perched on Noumena's chair gazing at the front door signaling that she'd like to be outside. As Noumena toddles over to Kisa, I encourage her to offer a gentle kiss, since she's already affectionately petting her.

I get Noumena dressed for the day, and we head to daycare.

* Shopping

Rather than going directly home after picking Noumena up from daycare, there were a few things I wanted to get from Target, so I take Noumena with me shopping. She's rather unhappy about being in her car seat for so long, but she's really not in there much longer than usual. I suspect she's less than content because she's tired. Her naps weren't logged in the app today, but they usually happen around 12pm and she wakes up at 1pm, so she's probably been awake for at least 4 hours.

I set Noumena in the main basket of the shopping cart thinking that will allay her discontentment. At first, it seems to be working, but shortly after I'm confronted with additional fussiness.

Noumena recently has a tendency to remove her shoes. The thought occurred to me that they may be uncomfortable, so I seek to find new ones at Target. My search turns out unsatisfactory. She's a size 4 or 5 and I'm unable to find anything that seems much better in those sizes. I suppose I'll have to head to the consignment store in order to find some decent ones.

Thinking Noumena's fussiness may also be attributable to her appetite, before we pick up the other items we need from shopping, I search for dried fruit I can feed her to temporarily satiate her. The first thing I found was Lara bars---very simple cereal bars made from whole ingredients---and tear them into chucks handing them to her as we weave through the grocery isles.

Approaching the checkout, I can see it's raining rather heavily. I should have anticipated the rain and brought in the umbrella especially since it had rained even harder on the car ride over. Nevertheless, we were going to get wet walking through the parking lot back to the car. As it turned out, the rain wasn't as heavy as it appeared, so we really weren't as wet as I anticipated we would be by the time we reached the car. Noumena remained awake the entire car ride back.

* Dinner

I wanted to get bread at the grocery store, but they didn't have any I liked, So Noumena is going to have to settle for soup alone for dinner. Regardless, I don't actually think she minds at all.

* Spending Time At Home

Noumena and I found ourselves confined indoors this evening as rain still fell from the sky even after we'd finished dinner. We make due by dispersing her toys throughout the living room, navigating from one to the next as she tires of them sequentially.

* A Short Walk

It's 8pm. I feel restless and the rain has stopped. Despite being unable to take her to the park given how late it is, I still want to go for a walk. I hoist Noumena atop my shoulders and we head out for a brief 15 minute stroll.

* Home After Walk

When we get home, the only thing capturing Noumena's attention is her books. We read her Elmo book several times before she finally grows weary of reading and picks up her etch-a-sketch and starts drawing. Holding the pen at the very end she scribbles indiscernible shapes onto the pad.

* Bath Time

A couple weeks ago, Noumena's mother bought her finger-paint-soap for the bath that I had neglected to use until now. Even though my expectations were modest, I was underwhelmed with the results of the finger paints. Although not entirely disinterested, Noumena was far from captivated. Still, we did manage to create a bit of a mess on the walls, so it wasn't a total waste.

* Bed Time

[[file:owl-pajamas.jpg]]

[[file:owl-pajamas-2.jpg]]

Since Noumena's favorite animal is owls and I saw pajamas with owls on them in Target, I purchased them for her. I put her in those and try to get a decent picture, admittedly failing to do so.

Regardless, we get her teeth brushed, feed the pets and it's time for bed.

We dance to Stevie Wonder and without hesitation Noumena is resting her head against my shoulder falling asleep immediately. We don't even get through /Isn't She Lovely/ before Noumena is asleep and it's just as well since we went to be a little later than usual. Still, I hold her in my arms cradled until /Stand By Me/ finishes playing through because I don't want to let her go. Her sleep is a bit uneasy. Slight perturbations arouse her, but I suspect once I lay her down she'll go right to sleep. I'm exactly right. She cries for less than a minute before passing out.

Noumena, every day with you is so precious to me. In some ways I don't like running errands with you because it feels like it cuts down on our play time. As I sit here teary eyed thinking of how much I love you, I hope I do my best to make you feel loved and adored every single day. It's no stretch of the imagination to say you are my everything---my reason for getting out of bed in the morning---my reason for trying to better myself so as to be a good influence on you.

I hope you sleep well Noumena and I hope the most wonderful dreams find you in that sleep.

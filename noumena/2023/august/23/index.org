* Morning
When Noumena woke up this morning, she was her normal cheery self. So eager was I to check on her that I left my bed and went straight to her room in my underwear. When I get to her crib, she's happy to see me. I feel her head and there's no temperature! Not literally, obviously. I don't mean to imply that she broke the laws of physics, but her fever has waned.

I'm so glad she's feeling better. She definitely isn't whining at all. I eat oatmeal with her, give her antibiotics, we get dressed and then we head out. On the ride there, she's just as gleeful as ever, babbling as we're headed there. She usually doesn't like care rides, but I think she's just happy to be rid of the sickness.

When we arrive, nothing seems amiss. But, when we get to her classroom, as long as she's in my arms she's comfortable. Usually, if I hand her off to the workers, she's content with them as I leave. But not today. I think that since she isn't 100% yet and also that she spent the last 4 days with me all day in conjunction with the fact that I was there when she needed me when she was sick made parting with me all the more difficult. She cries as I hand her to the worker and I tear up as I leave because I feel like I'm abandoning her when she really wants me. She's healthy enough to go to school, but it's still devastating to both of us.

* Picking Up Noumena
Oh my god I love Noumena so much. I missed her so much today because she was just coming off the sickness and I felt bad that I couldn't be with her all day. When I arrive at her day care, a worker picks her up from behind the gate to her class room and hands her to me. When she sees me she reaches out for me and her head immediately collapses into my shoulder once she's in my arms. She missed me too and needed a good pillow to lay on, evidently. She's stellar on the ride home as well, though, nearing home she did fall asleep. When I pull her out of her car seat, her head falls right against my chest. She doesn't even move it as we enter the house. I know that she needs a nap even though she slept 2 hours for a nap at daycare. She lays against my chest and I sway back and forth in her bedroom with her sound machine until she's asleep laying her down for a nap.

* Dinner
Noumena slept for about an hour. I woke her up just before 7pm to eat. She was so happy while we were eating dinner I just had to film her. I still have black bean soup left over so we make a meal out of that and she's gleeful the whole time. I really enjoy lately how she's gotten used to cleaning her hands after a meal. She used to resist, fight, and whine whenever you'd try to clean her hands after a meal, but now she'll just let you do it.

After dinner, we read a few books in the living room before Noumena decided she was tired with that at which point I thought it might be a good idea to go to the park.

* Park
It was about 7:15pm maybe when we head to the park. On the way, we see our dog friend Harley. Harley always runs across the yard when she sees us and Noumena loves it. Across the street from where Harley lives is where we often see the chickens. Today, I saw them and stopped to look at them. I'm not sure if Noumena did because they disappeared behind the house of the yard they were in shortly after we stopped. I chatted with Harley's owner for a bit about who owned those chickens and then we left to the park.

When we arrive, 2 teenage boys are climbing trees. They're the same boys that played soccer with Noumena on previous occasions. I situate Noumena in the swing facing them so she can watch them while she swings. I figured swinging would be a low effort activity and wouldn't be so demanding given she was just sick. She watches them climb down a branch and out of the tree eagle eyed the whole time.

When they're out of the tree, Noumena loses interest in swinging. I brought her out and set her on the ground and she just stared at the boys walking around. Eventually, one boy goes and picks up his soccer ball and starts playing with Noumena. She's not as active as she was last time she played but she definitely enjoyed it. He leaves very shortly after bizarrely telling me he's going to go take a shower but that he would come back tomorrow to play with her. I said okay and he left the park.

We continue our play by moving onto the platforms after she throws away a piece of trash… or rather has daddy throw it away this time because she's tired. Despite her being tired, she seems inclined to run and runs after daddy on the sidewalk after Daddy threw away the trash. I thought this was cute, so I prompted her to run after me again up to the platforms. There was a really cute photo opportunity that I totally wasn't fast enough to catch unfortunately.

She's not super active on the platforms, but appears to want to go down the slide, so I go down with her a few times. Afterward, we head back home.

* Night
It's 8pm when we get home and the first thing that catches Noumena's eye is the soymilk that was left on the table from dinner. Of course, I head up to it and give her a drink. We sat down to read a book, but she only let me get through one before losing interest. I'm not sure how we ended up in the bedroom, but we did. I made Chalmers kiss her on the bed and she had lots of fun with that. We ended up on the floor and she was trying to strangle herself with the charging cable! I asked her, "Noumena why are you doing that." She didn't answer…

We had so much fun just sitting there listening to music and playing together. I had left the bathroom door open and at some point she heads in that direction. I loudly said her name in a stern voice trying to convey I didn't want her in there. When she sees me start walking towards her, she runs out of the bathroom. She knew she wasn't supposed to be there and it was so cute.

* Bath Time
We played for such a long time that I didn't even notice the time and it was 8:40pm 10 minutes passed Noumena's usual bath time before I noticed and took her to the bath. I was extra careful with her because she really doesn't like baths when she's sick. She was better than yesterday, so that's good. I was really careful shampooing her hair because she definitely did not want that done. She was cautious, but did end up letting me clean her even if not as thoroughly as usual. Since we had gone to the bath late and I took extra time to be careful, it's almost time for bed when I take her out, so she doesn't even help with our usual routine of feeding the pets. Instead I brush her teeth and we head straight to bed.

* Bed Time
As is typical for Noumena, she rests her head right on my shoulder the moment the lights are off in her room. We only got through two songs in our playlist before she's out so hard that when I lay her down she doesn't stir even a little. Part of this must be due to the sickness recovery, but she gives me no trouble at all going to sleep.

Noumena, I'm glad you feel better, but I'm a little sad that you napped right when we got home because I missed you all day. Hopefully you don't need as much rest tomorrow so we can spend more time together.

You are my everything, baby girl. I feel so privileged to be your father and I feel so loved by you. Your love keeps me going every day baby and I just want you to know that I'd do anything for you. Good night, sweet girl. I hope your dreams are beautiful and you wake well rested.

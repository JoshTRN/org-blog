* Morning

This morning Noumena had a fever when I went into her room to wake her up at 8am. I think because she had a fever, she was maybe the thirstiest I've ever seen her save maybe when just getting back from vigorous play at the park. More than having a fever, to which Noumena has demonstrated considerable resilience in the past, she also has a powerful malaise for this round. Indeed, she doesn't seem to want to be away from Daddy for even a second unless she's sleeping.

I really haven't seen her this sick since she got COVID when she was about 4 months old. Then it was easier in a way. I have a very fond memory of wheeling her around in the stroller we hand then that doubled as a car seat so she could be next to me when I worked. I hated seeing her sick, but she slept a lot and I felt really close when she did.

Obviously, I can't take her to daycare and I can't afford to miss work, so while Noumena and I ate overnight oats together I called her mother to come over and take care of her during work hours. This proves rather futile, however. Noumena's become so attached to me she won't be satisfied without me even after having taken ibuprofen and Tylenol. She takes frequent naps throughout the day, so I do get a few good opportunities to focus on my work, but when Noumena is awake, she takes all my focus. Even the few times she sat in the living room and I tried to get her preoccupied with her mother or TV, she would just end up running down the hall crying with her arms outstretched because I was the only one who could console her.

* Lunch

She napped twice this morning once for about an hour and once for about 2. I take note of the fact that she seems to be touching her mouth a lot when she falls asleep and also she was touching it a lot earlier when I was holding her as well. Her second nap coincided with my lunch break so quickly I prepared what I thought was the quickest thing I could which was this Annie's boxed vegan macaroni and cheese.

As a weird tangent, I want to say it totally sucked. I don't usually get the kind with the pre-prepared cheese sauce you mix in. Instead, I get the kind with the powder. Don't get me wrong, the kind with the cheese powder is fantastic. It's been years since I've had macaroni and cheese so it's hard to say if this is an accurate comparison, but I'd say the one with the cheese powder rivals Kraft if not surpasses it. Anyway, when I cut the bag to poor the cheese sauce over the shells, I get a taste of the sauce. You can taste the prevalence of the sunflower seed oil. It tastes like sunflower seeds! I did my best to work with what I had by adding pepper and when that didn't make it all that much better, I thought a little bit of lemon juice would brighten the flavor. It helped, but that was just not very good stuff.

I ate some of it myself and when Noumena woke up I tried to feed some to her. She seemed like she was hungry because she put the food in her mouth but didn't actually eat it. I thought maybe it was just the food I was feeding her, but she wouldn't even eat dates. She also wasn't interested in drinking water, soymilk even sweet tasting sugar-free Gatorade! It was then I decided to take her to urgent care. If it were just the fever, I would have just let her work through it but not wanting to drink fluids coupled with the fact that her mouth seemed to be irritated is cause for concern. I thought it's possible she might have strep.

I run the car for a little while with her inside and fill her water bottle so she can drink it any time she needs it.

* Urgent Care

She let out dull whines almost the entire ride before falling asleep just as we arrived at the daycare. I brought her favorite blanket in with us for us to wait in the waiting room of the urgent care center. We end up waiting for quite a long time before Noumena sees the doctor.

Thankfully, when the doctor looks at Noumena she's not too invasive. That's good because I really hate having to hold her still when she's upset. It feels like such a betrayal. I do have to hold her head while the doctor looks in her ears and mouth. I am able to comfort her afterward pretty quickly, however as she lays back down comfortably on my chest. The doctor tells me that Noumena's ears are red and tonsils are red and swollen---she has an ear infection and will prescribe antibiotics. I asked the doctor if she thought it was strep and she told me it was hard to tell---that she didn't like strep tests because they have so many false negatives, but either way the antibiotics she's prescribing would work if it was strep.

Oddly enough, when we leave, Noumena seems to be in a better mood. I let her drive for a little while before putting her in her car seat and heading home.

* Nap Time

When we get home, I laid her right down for a nap. It was about 3:30pm and I had to finish work so I was happy she went to sleep so quickly. I went in to check on her at about 5pm and she was still asleep, so I just let her rest. This gives me time to make some black bean soup. I am concerned about her waking up, but it's a quick recipe so it shouldn't be too bad. She actually doesn't stir at all. In fact, I have to go in at 6:30 to wake her up because she's still asleep!

After waking her up from her nap, thankfully she's very thirsty. I pour some water into her cup and she drinks the whole thing. We have to go pick up her prescription, so I start walking with her to the pharmacy but before I go, I put some of the black bean soup in the freezer so it's cooled by the time we get back. I thought she'd like to be out in the daylight, but she doesn't at all. I get halfway down the street before realizing that I'm going to have to drive there. I strap her into her car seat and we head to the pharmacy. Thankfully, while we're there, she gets to do a lot of people watching and so she's content while we wait for her prescription. Once we get back to the car, I give Noumena her antibiotics. She likes it so much she wants more than the 5 milliliters! Sadly, I can't give it to her, so I strap her back into her car seat and we head home.

* Dinner

She appears to love the black bean soup I made and I'm so grateful. I made it a bit simpler for her than I usually do and I think that's good for both of us. I'm just happy that she feels well enough to eat.

* Evening

During the evening you wouldn't even know she's sick! In fact, she's wiggling away to get down when she's done with soup! We hang out for a couple of hours, read a lot of books and play with a lot of toys.

I forewent the bath this evening because I didn't want to do anything she thought would be traumatic. Plus this gives us more time together to be engaged in the things she wants to do. At about 8:30pm when we'd normally go for a bath, I decided instead a walk would be nice. Noumena's fairly content on the walk even enjoying it atop my shoulders. We walk for a few blocks before heading back home.

* Bed Time


It was about 8:51pm when we finished feeding the pets and so I turned on my playlist thinking it would be a long night. I was pleasantly surprised that when I turned off the light in her room her head fell straight across my chest like she knows it's bed time. She really is truly an amazing girl.

We get through our entire playlist dancing together and Noumena doesn't whine at all when going to be which is so surprising given how much she was groaning today.

Noumena, I'm going to stay with you tomorrow to make sure you get well. I'll try to do my best to make tomorrow as fun as can be given how you were today. Hopefully those antibiotics kick in and you feel much better tomorrow.

Sweet dreams my lovely baby. I hope you aren't disturbed in your sleep at all by your sickness!

* Beach

In the morning, after Noumena and I ate our breakfast, Noumena's mother came over for us to go to the beach. After she arrives, she changes Noumena into her bathing suit and we pack up our bags and head out.

* Lunch

When we get home, there's soup left over, so we eat that, but Noumena's more interested in the bread. She does eat enough soup to make me feel satisfied that she's eaten enough, however. After lunch, I hold her in my arms until she falls asleep taking her first nap of the day at about 1:30pm.

* Sitting Outside

Just as we were leaving the house, we saw Miss Theresa across the street. So before we leave, we sit together and just chat while Noumena sits on my lap. Eventually, Noumena gets up to play with the balls in the yard. I get her to toss it back and forth with me a few times. They also have a toddler basketball hoop. I get her to throw it in there a few times before we leave and head to the store.

* Target

I only wanted a few things. The stuff to make Noumena's porridge, my overnight oats and soy milk because it's much cheaper at target. When I see the bananas are 25 cents per bushel, I just have to buy them. That's 5 cents per banana. It's crazy. Anyway, I also find a really cute cup for Noumena, so I impulse bought that as well.

* Park

If I had known the name of the park I wanted to take her to, I could have gotten there a lot faster than the route I took. I think the park was maybe 5 minutes away from target. But since I couldn't remember the name, I had to take a route to where I knew it was. If I had thought about it for a little while, I could have used the map to figure out the name. But I learned the name of the park for next time. It's call Arlingwood park.

We play on the playground for a while, until a man and two kids show up. Because we see them, I want to go find out what they're doing so Noumena can watch. The man has a drone. He starts it, but then doesn't know how to control it. It ends up flying off and he totally lost it. I asked how much it cost and he said $50. We stayed there the entire time they were at the park as well. They never got the drone and they left in the car.

* Bed Time

[[file:falling-asleep-on-daddy.jpg]]

Noumena, Daddy is so tired tonight. I'm relying on the videos and photos to tell a lot of the story. I'm sorry, baby. Tomorrow it will be better.

I love you so much. I hope you sleep well.

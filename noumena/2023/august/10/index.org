* Morning


Noumena woke up early this morning as did I. It think it was about 7:30am when she started making noises. I did rest for a little bit before getting up, but not long. I got out of bed at about 7:40am, warmed Noumena's porridge, made myself some coffee and went in at about 7:45am to get her out of her crib. Again, she's insisting on me picking her up rather than standing up herself. I'm not quite sure what got into her. We say good morning to the owls and she gives them kisses before I take her to let Chalmers out with me. Noumena and I eat breakfast together and then I change her into her clothes to get ready for daycare. After getting her changed, she sees her toy phone inside the diaper carrier I use at Noumena's changing station. I didn't even know it was in there before. Maybe she somehow put it in there. I grab it out for her to play with and we head into the living room.

We're going late to daycare today because we have an person from a government program for infants and toddlers coming to evaluate Noumena's speech. He gets there at 9am and we go over a few questions about Noumena's gross motor, fine motor, communication and social skills. She excels in all categories except communication. She scored 2 out of 6 on that I think which was enough to recommend speech therapy. The questions were like how any words she knows and of course she only knows "owl" right now. I'm not truly concerned about it, but at her last pediatrician appointment, the doctor said it couldn't hurt and I agreed with that.

Since she woke up earlier than usual, she actually fell asleep on the way to daycare. I felt bad about waking her up when we arrived, but she seemed fine. Between 9 and 10am they take the toddler class outside to play at the playground at the daycare facility and it's between those times when we arrive, so I walk in through one door of the facility and out the other where the play ground is handing Noumena off to one of the workers. The playground is fenced in with fences about 5 Â½ feet high and lined with a green mesh covering the kind it's possible to see through if you're moving, but not if you're stationary. I peek my head over the fence and make noises to get Noumena to look in my direction. Once she realizes I'm there, I hide below the fence and jump repeatedly exposing my head as I say "hi, Noumena!" She absolutely loves it and it causes the daycare worker to start laughing which is pretty great. She picks Noumena up and holds her close to the fence so I can give her a kiss goodbye and then I depart.

* Shopping

I basically ran out of groceries this week. It's probably because I didn't plan a big grocery haul like I usually do. Instead, on Monday, I just grabbed some stuff I knew I'd need for certain recipes. In any case I wasn't sure what I was going to do for dinner so I took Noumena to Publix after daycare. She fell asleep on the way there and we arrived at about 5:30pm. I didn't want to wake her up, so I turned on a video I wanted to listen to also and took a nap right along side her in the car until 6pm. At that point, it was time to wake her up.

I went a little crazy on produce, getting stuff for salads but both mangoes and dragon fruits were on sale, so I had to get a good amount. The mangoes only cost a dollar each, so how could I resist. When I was a kid, I used to think cantaloupe was my favorite fruit, but I haven't actually had it in years and ever since putting mango in Noumena's porridge, I have been eating it a lot and I definitely think it's my new favorite fruit.

I thought macaroni and cheese (vegan) would be really easy, so I bought that and green beans as well for us to have fore dinner.

* Evening

When we get home, I'm trying to distract Noumena so I have time to cook. I really don't like putting her in her room while I do that stuff and would much rather she just hang out with free roam of the house while I cooked. I grab out her multicolored balls and let her play with those for a little while. Eventually, though, I think her hunger is causing a lot of frustration and she doesn't understand why Daddy hasn't fed her yet, so she starts throwing a mild tantrum. I can't do anything about it because I'm preparing our food, so she just kind of has to deal with it. There are some really funny moments during the tantrum though that I wish I had gotten on camera. The dramatic behaviors are so over the top it really is funny.

* Dinner

After the food is ready, Noumena is still throwing a tantrum. I know it's because she's hungry. As I put her into her high chair, she calms a little bit. I give her some of the macaroni and cheese and she begins to eat. My reason for feeding her before putting her bib on was I thought if she had eaten a little it would make putting her bib on more manageable. This was a mistake---I probably should have put on the bib first. I think she interprets this as me stopping her from eating and she starts crying---not like tantrum, like crying tears. I feel so bad for her. She gets so upset it takes a little while for her to start eating again. I hate seeing her upset like that. She does calm down relatively quickly though---within 30 seconds--- and starts eating and feels much better.

Even though it's about 7:30pm I still want to take her to the park. I actually have been feeling like I want to take her to newer places, but I'm not exactly sure where to take her on the weekdays when we have so little time. Anyway, I tell her to pick up her shoes, and to my surprise she does it! I didn't think she would do it so I didn't film it the first time, so I manufactured doing it again just because I wanted to film it.

* Park

While we're walking to the park, I point to all the trees saying "tree" every time. I think a couple times she mimicked me and so got super excited! Remember, I said a couple days ago I thought "tree" would be her second word. I'm not quite convinced that she knows it just yet, but she seems super close. When we get to the park, the boys there were there a few days ago are there again with their soccer ball. A few times, she actually says "ball"! She says it a enough times for me to believe it's intentional. She's learned how to say ball!!!

Obviously, we can't stay too long not only because it's late but because Noumena soiled her diaper so we head back. We get back at around 8:20pm.

* Home

Remember what I said about using the multicolored balls to distract her? Well, they're dispersed across the whole of the living room and a little down the hall as well. At first I try to get her to help me to clean up the balls, but it becomes apparent rather quickly that this is futile. The temptation to play with the zip-up net which contains the balls and the balls themselves proves too great to be worried about putting them away, so I take it upon myself to clean up the balls myself while Noumena plays with other toys nearby.

* Bath/Bed time

Our bath and bed time are normal for the most part, but for some reason when it's time to brush her teeth she gives me an unusually hard time doing so. I end up having to try for much longer to get her to brush her teeth. We look in the mirror a bit and then I take her into her room to dance to our music before laying her down.

She falls asleep to /Isn't She Lovely/ before /Stand By Me/ comes on in the playlist. I hold her in my arms as she falls asleep kissing her periodically before laying her in bed to go to sleep.

Good night, my wonderful sweet heart. I'm going to figure out something really fun for us to do this weekend! I love you so much!

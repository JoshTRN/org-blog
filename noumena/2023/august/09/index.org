* Morning

I woke up at 7am this morning, but once I realized what time it was I went right back to sleep. Noumena on the other hand started making noise at around 7:50am. I left her in there until 8am and then I got out of bed. I get ready before entering Noumena's room to get her out of bed. She's been really funny lately with not getting up right away, but rolling around and reaching her hands up so I have to pick her up. It was just last month that she would stand up and throw her blanket out. It's so crazy how fast they change and pick up new habits or try new things.

Noumena takes her time eating porridge this morning. It seems as though her appetite hasn't entirely returned. After breakfast, I give her her dose of antibiotic and ibuprofen and then get her dressed and ready to go. We leave right after getting dressed because it's 8:30am by the time we're ready.

* Daycare

* Evening

When I pick Noumena up from daycare she doesn't seem excited to see me. It's weird, normally she jumps up and runs to me before turning around expecting me to chase her. Today, however, one she sees me, she just stays put and starts whimpering. It is really funny, but totally inexplicable. I'm not sure, maybe she felt lazy. The daycare worker picks her up by her hands and walks her to me. Once she's in my arms, she's content, but that was very funny.

Once we're outside of the facility, I start spinning Noumena around excitedly telling her I missed her so much and that I love her when a woman who was talking to the daycare director as I arrived asks me how Noumena likes the toddler class. I tell her that Noumena seems to like it quite a bit and talk about how once she got used to the workers there, she's absolutely fine when I drop her off every morning. The woman tells me her baby is 13 months old and how she's nervous. I tell her there's nothing to be nervous about before strapping Noumena into the car seat and we part ways.

I went straight to Noumena's room when we arrived to put her shoes away, but once we're in there I remember I got Noumena to give the owls a kiss and so I have to get it on film.

* Dinner

I'm running out of groceries, but I have tofu and some stuff to make tofu scramble so I decide that's what we're having tonight. Initially, Noumena is distracted playing with her toys in the living room when I start cooking and I would have just let her play in there if it she had just stayed there. She brings her toy truck that carries plastic shape blocks and holes to place them in into the kitchen. The rear door to the truck was shut too tightly for her to open it, so she was asking me to open it for her. She can't stay in the kitchen while I cook, so when I open it for her, I observe her for a bit to see if she'll take it back into the living room. She doesn't though, so I have to shut her in her room. I brought her blocks out and put Chalmers in there so she wouldn't be bored, but she cries anyway. I'm too paranoid about her getting her to let her stay in there though, so she has to remain in her room.

After a few minutes, Noumena gets distracted by her diapers and flings them all over the room, so she's content. I plate our dinner and go and grab her to eat.

* Hanging Out At Home

I try to clean up a little while letting Noumena play in the living room after dinner, but she wants Daddy's attention so I end up hanging out with her instead. She picks up a piece of the cucumber she had thrown off the high chair at meal time and is eating it now... but she's doing it in a really weird way.

I had Nevermore stuck in my head so we listen to /The Death Of Passion/ and /This Godless Endeavor/ while dancing in the bedroom together and being obnoxious with the music. Afterward, we head to the park.

* Park

As I drive to the park, within moments of beginning to drive Noumena falls asleep---and I mean immediately. She must be extremely tired. I try to keep her awake, but she doesn't like that at all. She starts crying when I try to keep her awake. It's okay for her to take a 5 minute nap I think to myself, so I allow her to rest while I drive. Once arriving at the park, I take Noumena up to the trees on our way to the playground. She loves trees. She loves them so much, for my money I think her next word is going to be "tree." I say it many times and she seems as though she's almost copying me saying it. Four other kids arrive just as we enter the playground, so she gets an opportunity to play with them.

As we're leaving the park, I decide to go to the corner store nearby to get water since I didn't bring any with us. On the way there, we have to cross an 4 way stop intersection. A car approaches a little fast and I'm carrying my baby so I give the driver a dirty look. He's a stupid teenager listening to rap music and apparently doesn't appreciate the look, so he starts rapping the vulgarities in the song very loudly to offend me. The funny part is that I don't actually care about vulgar language and I don't really care if my kid hears it either, so it's just kind of funny.

* Home Before Bed

Noumena stays awake for the whole car ride home. Entering the house, it's approximately 8pm, so we have about half an hour before it's time for her to take a bath. I read her a few books and then she wants to walk around a little, but she's really tired. Eventually she starts resting on my chest.

* Bath/Bed Time

In the beginning of the bath, Noumena had returned to normal from her sickness. She got right into the tub and didn't complain at all. Curiously, though, she tried to get out of the tub early. I didn't allow her because I hadn't rinsed her hair or cleaned her body, so she didn't like that too much. Once I got her cleaned, though, she just accepted it and calmed down. Afterward, I brush her teeth, feed the pets and put on our music to go to bed too.

Surprisingly, Noumena doesn't fall asleep to /Isn't She Lovely/. I thought for sure she would. She does fall asleep during /Stand By Me/ however and when she does she's out like a light. I knew she was going to sleep hard. She was tired before she wore herself out at the park! Afterward, forget about it.

I kiss her a few times before laying her in the crib. She doesn't move a muscle when I lay her down, that' show tired she is.

I'm glad you're feeling better today Noumena. See you in the morning!

Good night, my amazing, wonderful, lovely, precious little girl!

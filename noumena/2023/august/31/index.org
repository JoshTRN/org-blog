* Morning

This morning, Noumena's mother woke her up when she arrived at about 8:40am. She changed Noumena's diaper while I got her porridge ready and sat down with her to eat. Noumena and I ate porridge together before I started my day in the office.

* Spending Time With Mommy All Day

I came out several times during the day to hang out with Noumena. It's so great having her home so I can see her throughout the day.

Noumena's mom wanted to take her to McDonald's for her first happy meal, so she did that. I'm not actually sure what they did most of the day. I know that Noumena went down for a nap at about 1pm and slept for almost 2 hours.

* Dinner

I had bade a bean salad for lunch that had garbanzo beans, kidney beans, pinto beans and marinated artichoke hearts mixed with just a little bit of salt and pepper. Since there was a lot, I had some left over. Noumena and I ate the rest of that for dinner along with soy milk to wash it down. Pretty much right after dinner we headed to the park.

* Park

Right when I set her down, the first thing she does is start picking up sticks, trying to eat leaves and throwing them around.

I saw a football just sitting under the gazebo, so I picked it up and decided to play with Noumena with it. It was so much fun.

After a little while of playing, a little boy came with his family to the park. While he was swinging on the swings, I asked Noumena if she wanted to go over and swing with him. She did, so we go over there. He loves watching me spin her around, flip her, and swing her high on the swings. I asked him what his name was and he replied "Enzo." He didn't speak much english, but he did a little. I got Noumena to toss the football down the slide and Enzo sat there and tossed it back and forth to her. She caught the ball a few times and I was so proud of her.

* Back At Home

As we approach the house, I stop at the mailbox and pick up the mail. There are ads in it, so I let Noumena play with them in the living room while I read a letter addressed to her about Early Steps for speech therapy.

Since yesterday she did so well drinking out of a cup herself and I thought she might be thirsty from the park, so I pour a little water into her cup and set it on the floor for her to try to drink herself.

I saw the neighbor out on the porch on the way back home, so I figured we'd go over and say hi.

* Neighbors

I saw that Jeremiah was there because his parents car was there. We sat down and talked with Miss Theresa for almost an hour. We just sat and talked about a bunch of random stuff. Noumena didn't really want to get off my lap. Most of the time she just sat there listening to mine and Theresa's conversation. Eventually, she does get off my lap and plays with Jeremiah's bubble machine. Not long later, we head back to get ready for bath time.

When we get back home, we wrestle on the bed until bath time.

* Bath/Bed Time

Bath time was back to normal like she was before she was sick or had a diaper rash---very easy going. She didn't want to sit down again, so I washed her body before shampooing her hair, but when I shampooed her hair, she didn't give me any trouble rinsing it out or anything. She made brushing her teeth really easy tonight too which was awesome and totally unexpected since she had been fighting it recently.

We fed the pets and I held her as I removed the garbage cans from the garage as I had put them in there so they wouldn't blow around in the hurricane.

It's almost 9pm when we get in her room and turn the lights off. Noumena starts out singing with the song but end up completely out by the time /Isn't She Lovely/ is over. Even though she's fast asleep, I sing /Stand By Me/ with her all the way through rocking her and holding her against my chest.

Noumena, I love spending time with you so much. You fill my life with joy and meaning. You are my everything and want you to know that every single day. I want you to understand that there is nothing Daddy wouldn't do if he thought he could make your life just a little bit better. I will sacrifice everything for you, baby. You are my world.

Sleep tight, wonderful little Noumena.

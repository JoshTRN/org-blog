* Morning

Today, Noumena's mother came at about 8:30am. I didn't even get Noumena out of bed. Instead Noumena's mother got her out of her crib and changed her diaper while I prepared Noumena's porridge for breakfast. Since Noumena can't go to daycare as they're closed down through Thursday, Noumena's mother came to supervise her while I work.

* Home all day

It was really wonderful being able to periodically leave my office and get to see Noumena throughout the day. I miss having the ability to come out and play with her whenever I can take a break at work.

Noumena's mother took her to the Nature Center today. I'm sure she had fun there.

Near the end of the day, I came out of my office and Noumena's mom had given her the whole can of puffs. It had probably gone unnoticed in the pantry for months. Noumena picked up the can, turned it upside down and spilled puffs all over the place.

* Dinner

Mom leaves at about 5:40pm a little while after I got off work. After she left, Noumena started getting pretty fussy. I couldn't really tell why, but she didn't seem to want to do anything in particular. I thought it might be that she was tired, so I laid her in her crib to see if she was tired. I tried rocking her for a little while and she seemed like she was about to go to sleep, but you could tell she was fighting it.

I tried something different for dinner. I just had a few ingredients I thought would be good together even though I didn't see any recipes with them. I fried some dark kidney beans with some garlic and onion and added soy sauce to have of them. I had originally intended to add teriyaki sauce, but discovered I didn't have any. The rest of the dinner was rice and lentils that I had made for lunch. As I was cooking, you could hear Noumena resisting sleep in her bedroom. She wasn't fussing at all, so you knew she was content, but she was talking and making noise. Eventually, she fell asleep.

I finished cooking right around 6:30pm and that was lucky as that was when I intended to wake Noumena up anyway. She eats a good amount of food, so I'm happy with that.

* Playing in Living Room

She's super active after eating and in a much better mood from her nap but her belly is as full as it gets. I sit down to read with her, but she's shortly distracted by Chalmers. She watches me play with Chalmers for a while just standing there. I repeatedly bonk him on the head with an inflatable cylindrical toy of Noumena's and he tries to bite it running around. That's enough to keep her interested for sure.

I was tired of being inside all day and wanted to go outside. I had originally intended to take Noumena on a walk, but when we got outside we saw the neighbors across the street and their grandbaby Jeremiah. We go over to visit.

* Hanging Out With Jeremiah

When we get across the street, all Noumena wants to do is sit on my lap. It takes a while for her to get comfortable. Once I set her down and prompt her to explore a little, she feels better. I move back and forth with the kids from the front yard to sitting on the porch occasionally spinning Noumena or flipping her from my shoulders onto the ground. Jeremiah hesitates a bit, but wants to be spun as well. I grab him by his arms and spin him while Noumena watches. At first he likes it, but then he gets scared so I set him down. This doesn't stop him from coming back for more, however, and each time he's scared. It's so cute. Like watching a scary movie or something.

We hang out until it gets to be around 8:15pm and so Noumena and I leave to get ready for bath time.

* Bath Time

Before bath, Noumena doesn't seem to want to be left to her own devices at all. Instead she's stuck to daddy. So we listen to music and dance around the house until it's time for bath.

I didn't notice that Noumena had soiled her diaper at some point. That makes 3 times today. I put the desitin on each time after she did. I think her rash is a bit better. Since I didn't know she had pooed, I took off her diaper with her standing up. Thankfully, I didn't make a mess at all, but it was not pleasant wiping her down standing up. I did a poor job of it, but figured she's taking a bath anyway, so I don't have to worry about it too much. I carried her to the tub horizontally facing the ground because I obviously didn't want to touch her butt.

Noumena stands in the bath for a really long time, water up to her shins. She usually sits down right away. A few times she squats down, but then gets back up immediately. She's not really upset, just being careful. I'm not sure exactly why but I suspect it has something to do with the rash. I was very patient with her, and eventually she sits and I start wetting her hair. She didn't mind me wetting her hair, but for some reason she didn't like me shampooing it. She was fine at first, but after I was doing it too long, she let me know. After carefully rinsing the shampoo out of her hair, I use the small rope that used to be attached to a sea sponge and is now in her hands being played with to get her to stand. I quickly and carefully wash her privates. She struggles a bit, but I think eventually realizes that it's not that bad and calms down.

After getting Noumena dressed in her owl pajamas, it's time to brush her teeth. She's such a pain about brushing her teeth these days I can't wait for this phase to end. She used to like looking in the mirror while brushing her teeth but it appears to just be a distraction recently, so I exit the bathroom into the hallway where there are considerably fewer distractions to get her to brush her teeth. We don't bother feeding the pets because I had fed them earlier.

* Bed Time

It's 8:55pm by the time I get into Noumena's darkened bedroom. I start her playlist and even though she's asleep by the end of the first song, I listen to the whole playlist with her because it just feels so good to hold her against my chest. Peacefully as ever, she's laid in bed and goes to sleep without any fuss whatsoever.

I'm glad you got to spend time with your mom today Noumena and even doubly glad we got to see each other more frequently throughout the day! Any time I missed you I could come out and see you and it was wonderful!

I hope you sleep well, my precious baby. See you tomorrow! I love you!

* Morning

I really appreciate Noumena letting me sleep. I slept all the way until 7:55am, hit the snooze twice and got out of bed at 8:05am. I bought soymilk, so we're back on our regular porridge. This time, however, a tartness not usually present emerged as honeycrisp apples were not used to make it, instead it was prepared with granny smith golden delicious apples. Noumena, sitting on my lap, insists on allowing her to use the spoon from time to time rather than Daddy feeding her.

By the time we're finished it's almost time to go. I have to use the restroom, so I set Noumena down. As she's distracted, I make my way to the restroom. Once again, she follows me in and I have to resort to throwing a bottle in order to get her to leave me in peace. We leave shortly thereafter.

* Picking Noumena Up

The nose piece of my glasses had recently broken and I scheduled an appointment to get them fixed and thought I might as well get an eye exam also. The appointment was for 4:00pm today leading to an updated prescription, a new frame, the repair of the nose piece. They should come in the next few weeks. The appointment didn't last long, so I'm able to pick Noumena up from daycare a bit earlier than usual which is a nice bonus.

As I picked up Noumena, I noticed another little girl crying at the daycare. Holding Noumena in my arms, we began dancing to bring some cheer to the upset girl. After a while, her tears began to fade. Once she seemed to feel a bit better, I put Noumena in the car and decided to call Chris. He had suggested getting dinner together, so I wanted to see if he was still interested. After a quick chat, we agreed to meet up. With our plans set, Noumena and I headed out, ready for the evening ahead.

Arriving at Chris' house, Noumena recognizes him instantly, prompting me to hand her over. She's fine in his arms for a few seconds, but then she extends her arms back to me. Meanwhile, Chris is busy in the kitchen, putting away dishes, while I catch up with him. Noumena's gaze remains fixed on him as he works. Vanessa, his wife, joins us, and as I pass Noumena to her, she starts crying immediately. I quickly take Noumena back into my arms.

When Chris is done, we all move to the living room to discuss dinner plans. Throughout our conversation, Noumena remains on my lap, observing Chris and Vanessa intently. As the moments pass and she starts feeling more at ease, Noumena lets Vanessa hold her without fuss.

With our dinner destination decided, it's time to leave Chris' house. Vanessa takes hold of Noumena's hand and insists that she guide her down the stairs, shooing me away gently.

* Dinner

We've decided to go to a place called Hawkers---Vanessa affectionately calling it "Hookers"---for Asian street food. There, I order the /Hawker’s Delight/ which is described on their menu as a "Saucy blend of wok-seared tofu, broccoli, carrots, napa, bell peppers and straw mushrooms served with jasmine rice" as well as some spring rolls. The spring rolls are expensive. Seven dollars for only 2 and I didn't even think they were very good. Noumena seemed to have a different perspective. She apparently loved them, and that's all that's really important. Honestly, I think she ate more of the food than I did. Hawkers, being literally across the street from Riverside Park, leads us to go there after we've finished eating.

* Riverside Park

Noumena is carried by Vanessa across the street, and the moment we're within the confines of the park on the sidewalk, Vanessa sets Noumena down, grabbing her hand and guiding her down the trail. Noumena's independent spirit takes over and she's moved to walk and even run all by herself down the path.

After wandering somewhat aimlessly, we start heading back the direction we came, stopping at the playground for Noumena to play, of course. Vanessa is so worried about Noumena's risk-taking. She's just unfamiliar with how much of a daredevil Noumena is, so that's why she's worried. I am, of course, completely unfazed by Noumena's antics. I know she's smart enough to know which risks to take and which to avoid.

Vanessa has a firsthand view of Noumena's inclination to tidy up the playground. She watches as Noumena grabs a discarded bottle and diligently carries it across the playground to dispose of it on the other side despite feeling uneasy about it as she's is concerned about the cleanliness of picking up trash.

After about 20 minutes of play, it's time to go, so I follow Chris and Vanessa back to there car telling Noumena to give them a kiss when they leave. Noumena's kisses right now are really more of a very like headbutt sort of like a cat, so she does that to both Chris and Vanessa's cheeks. We begin to walk away saying our goodbyes. Realizing we're saying goodbye, Noumena extends her hand to wave at Chris and Vanessa. We head to the car, I strap Noumena into the car seat and we head home.

* Park Near Home

I realize we have more time to kill so I stop at the park near our house before heading home. As usual, she's very preoccupied with tidying the park.

* Home

Arriving home, I remove the paper ads from the mailbox and we head inside. Once inside, I decide to let Noumena have some fun with the papers, which is probably one of the few occasions where I've actually found a purpose for those ads—keeping my child entertained.

She wanders from room to room finding her way into the kitchen pointing at the glass of water I had poured when we arrived. Spotting the glass of water I had poured earlier, she points at it, indicating her interest. I offer her the glass, but things don't quite go as planned—she accidentally spills it on the floor and ends up slipping in the water.

Interestingly, up until this moment, Noumena hadn't noticed the marks on her feet that resemble bite marks. I use the term "bite marks" because they appear similar to the boils that had formed when she had been bitten before. She seems to be growing more aware of the discomfort, attempting to scratch the affected areas. Having observed her earlier wandering without being bothered by the marks, it becomes apparent that Noumena just needs a diversion to keep her attention away from the discomfort.

* Bath Time

I remember writing a journal entry about when I discovered a way to distract Noumena in the bath by sticking the letters to the wall allowing me to wash the shampoo out of her hair. I said something about always finding new ways to innovate. Since then, innovation is sorely needed. Periodically, the letters trick works, but less and less as time goes on.

As I have been playing with her toys in the bath with her recently, today I encircled her with her boat making boat noises as I did so. This led to her grabbing the boat and sticking it in my mouth! As with food, sticking anything in my mouth is extremely entertaining. As she laughs, I've discovered the perfect opportunity to rinse the shampoo out of her hair! I repeated the scenario until her hair was thoroughly rinsed.

When Noumena's all clean, I dress her and we go to brush her teeth. She gave me an unusually obnoxious time brushing her teeth this evening. I had to move her around to the other side of the bathroom to coax her into letting me to put the toothbrush in her mouth.

We feed the pets and head to bed to listen to our bed time music.

* Bed Time


Before I even put on /Isn't She Lovely/ Noumena is already resting her head against my chest. I didn't get updates from the daycare app today, so I'm not sure when she last napped, but she didn't nap at any point since picking her up. She must be very tired. I lay her down after cradling her while listening to /Stand By Me/.

Noumena, witnessing your growth and transformation is the most fulfilling part of my life. I love how observant you are when put in new situations. I love how discerning you are with new people. Exploring the facets of your emerging personality melts my heart every single day. I miss you as I write this to you and am half-tempted to wake you up to shower you with more affection. Sadly, that will have to wait until morning. See you in the morning, kid. I love you.

* Morning

Noumena woke me up this morning at about 8:30am. I got out of bed but I had run out of oats to make overnight oats, so I resorted to instant oatmeal. I didn't want her to have only oatmeal, however, so I also cut up a granny smith apple to share with her.

After breakfast, we got out a bunch of Noumena's books but she wasn't really interested in reading them today... just spreading them all over the living room. We play with some toys and hang out around the house before we head to the library to meet Noumena's mother for story time.

* Story Time

Right as we pull up, Mom pulls up right behind us. I pull Noumena out of the car seat and hand her to Mommy to carry to the library. In short order, Mommy is tired saying that Noumena's too heavy so I carry her the rest of the way into the library. As we enter through the doors, I set Noumena down in the lobby. I hold her hand and excitedly say "let's run, Noumena!" to get her to try and keep up with us. I honestly don't even slow my pace and she's able to keep up. When we get to the stairs, Noumena takes some of the stairs by herself and some of them holding Daddy's hand. At some point she starts taking the stairs one per foot when she's holding my hand. I'm so proud of my little girl growing up!

We exit to pass through the courtyard on the second floor where the fountain is and prompt Noumena to follow us out the door. She saw other stairs and wanted to climb them, but once she saw we were far enough out the door, she started to chase us down. It was a little early for story time, so we went to the playroom before it began and played with some toys before heading into the room where story time is hosted.

* Lunch

I hadn't eaten, so I invited Noumena's mother out to lunch. It wasn't super simple to decide where to go, so we went to the same place as last week: Super Food And Brew. I ordered some tofu dish and shared that with Noumena. Noumena's mother also shared her food with Noumena but she didn't appear to be very hungry.

After dropping Mommy off at her car, on the drive home Noumena falls right asleep. When we get home, I put Noumena down for a nap and take one at the same time. I ultimately regretted napping because when she woke up, she woke me up as well and I just felt groggy after that.

* Home

We woke up at 2:45pm about and hung out around the house until a little after 4pm. I gave her a puree because I didn't have any prepared food, so those came in clutch.

* Arboretum

I decided to take Noumena to the arboretum today. Before leaving, I filled up her water bottle and even put a couple ice cubes in there so it would still be cool when she went to drink it and we headed out. We spent a long time there. We went down almost every path you can go on there. When she started getting tired, I took her back to the car to rehydrate and then we went back for more.

* Dinner

Noumena falls asleep as we get home from the arboretum. I set her down in her crib at about 5:45pm. This is good because it gives me time to make soup for us. As she sleeps, I make a broccoli, potato, carrot, onion and celery soup with alphabet letters. When she wakes up at 6:30, it's not quite ready. It needs to cool down, so I put some in a bowl and try to distract her until it cools. Nothing in the house works. She is as hungry as can be and is letting me know it. She doesn't want anything to do except eat. She wouldn't take one of those purees either. My guess is she wants something savory.

I decide to take her on a short walk while the soup cools in the freezer and see our neighbor's mother Miss Theresa out there, so we go and visit for a short while before coming back home to eat some soup. Noumena is so hungry, she eats the whole bowl I had prepared for her then wants more! I emptied what I had onto her tray and put another bowl of soup back into the freezer to cool.

* Grocery Store

I didn't prepare a whole list, but I do need a few things so I can get through the day tomorrow when we take our bigger shopping trip, so I get stuff for our oatmeal, Noumena's porridge and some dates because those always come in handy when I'm trying to give her a quick snack that takes a little while for her to eat to get her off my back for a few moments when I'm trying to concentrate on something else!


* Park

Leaving the grocery store, I see that it's about 7:50pm. I realize that if I take the car to the park, I can stay there with her until 8:15pm before having to head home for bath time, so I decide to do that. She sees a neighborhood girl swinging on the swings as we get there so I prompt Noumena to say "hi" and she does. The girl comments on how big Noumena has gotten and asks how old she is. Noumena wants to swing along side her, so I put her in the swing. While Noumena swings, she stars at the girl the entire time. It's so cute.

After swinging, I chase Noumena around and onto the platforms, though she's not as active as usual. She laughs a lot as I make noises and chase her on the platforms though, so that's a lot of fun. At some point, she gets back down on the ground and I get her to chase me onto the picnic benches. She witnesses me jump back and forth between the benches and wants to participate. I pick her up onto the benches and hold her when she attempts to jump from one bench to the other.

We finish up at the park by returning to the swings and then saying goodbye to the girl.

* Bath/Bed Time

Arriving at home, I still had the groceries in the trunk of the car. Before removing Noumena from her car seat, I organize the bags so I can grab them all with on hand. I manage to carry Noumena and all the bags in, set them down on the stove and then we hang out in the living room listening to music before I take her into the bath tub.

Bath time was pretty usual, but I got good at spotting opportunities to rinse her head. When I change her diaper after bath, I realize that I had forgotten to bring her folded pajamas back into her room, so I take her to my room to get them and lay her on my bed to change her. It's a struggle the whole time. She's resisting and I'm making a game out of it. I'm annoyed but having so much fun at the same time and she's absolutely loving trying to get away while I try to dress her.

We head to brush her teeth and she's being horrible about it. I'm not sure when this started, but it's gotten gradually more difficult to brush her teeth. I hope it's just a phase. I eventually just hold her arm out of my way to get the toothbrush in her mouth. She's not happy about it, but she'll live. We feed the pets before heading to bed.

As is usual, Noumena rests immediately on my chest the second the lights are out in her room and we're dancing together. She's easily asleep by the middle of /Isn't She Lovely/, but we listed to /Stand By Me/ the whole way through also because I don't want to let her go. I love holding her so much and am just trying to appreciate it because there will soon come a time when I'm no longer going to be able to hold her as she's falling asleep anymore.


Noumena, we had so much fun today. Sorry about the poor planning that led you to be a little hungrier than usual! I'm going to make sure you're super well fed next weekend, so I'll try not to run out of groceries for the week.

I loved going to the arboretum with you and I'm excited to take you to the beach tomorrow!

You're the best thing that's every happened to me and I'm so grateful you came into my life. You are my everything, baby girl, and I want you to know that and feel that from me every single day of your life.

Good night, Noumena. Sleep soundly and I'll see you in the morning!

* Morning

This morning, Noumena's mother came by at 8:30am and woke Noumena up this morning. We intended on going to the beach but Noumena awoke with a mild fever so decided not to go. Mommy reads Noumena some books while I get her breakfast ready. Noumena and I eat together, but her food seems a bit less appetizing than usual because she's sick. Not long afterward, when I'm holding her she rests on my chest. Because she's so tired, I lay down with her caressing her face until she falls asleep. She ends up sleeping for another 20 minutes.

* Lunch

Since we aren't going to the beach, Noumena's mother asked if we'd like to go to lunch instead. I agree to lunch and decide that Thai sounds good, so we head there. Unfortunately, the Thai place is closed when we arrive. It could have been avoided had I just looked it up before heading there. Noumena's mother suggests a place that's close by called Super Food and Brew. I was so confident that they were closed on Sunday. I thought I had tried to eat there in the past and I suppose it's possible that their hours have changed, but having thought that they were closed I suggested some place called Uptown Kitchen. When we arrive there, it's a 45 minute wait. We don't want to wait that long and don't know where else to go so Noumena's mother looks up Super Food and Brew and discovers they're open so we head there.

We had gone around so much that Noumena had fallen asleep in the car. I felt bad for getting her up since she wanted to sleep, but it wasn't so bad because she had only slept for maybe a minute and she's not too fussy while we eat. Noumena shared my fried rice bowl and her mothers sandwich and was less picky that this morning. After lunch, we head home and Mommy says goodbye.

* Afternoon

Surprisingly, Noumena didn't sleep on the car ride home. She is a little fussy when I bring her inside, but I am able to cradle her in my arms before laying her down for sleep. She goes to sleep well right away and doesn't even make a move when I lay her down. This doesn't last long, however. After about 20 minutes, she's crying louder than she usually does, so I rush into comfort her. I get her calm in my arms for a few minutes, but when I set her back down she cries out again. This time, her cries are not as intense, so I think she'll go back to sleep. Sure enough, after about 3 minutes she's out again. In total, Noumena slept about 3 and a half hours again.

I wake Noumena up right after it reaches 4pm. Despite the light clothing she was wearing, when I wake her up she's covered in sweat, yet her fever has apparently completely abated. Even though she shows no sign of fever, you can still tell she's a little under the weather. While she's in this state, I'm the most helicopter parent ever. It's funny because otherwise Noumena is so strong and since I know this I let her take quite a lot of calculated risks as well as get hurt quite a bit. But when she's sick, I can never be too accommodating for my little girl. Even the slightest twinge of sadness prompts inordinate coddling from me.

We hang out around the house and I try to feed her but she's not having it.

* Grocery Shopping

I still needed to get groceries to prepare us food for the week, so put on the new shoes that Noumena's mother bought her and we head out. She fared fairly well in the store though at one point no longer wanted to be confined to the seat in the cart. Instead, I hoisted her upon my shoulders while she helped me weave through the grocery isles.

Upon arriving home, Noumena remains attached to my hip the whole time as I bring the groceries in from the house. I used to worry about leaving the door wide open because I didn't trust Chalmers not to leave the house and start running a muck. I'm uncertain of what changed, but now, however, I trust Chalmers enough to stay in the house with the door open. Noumena and I make 4 trips from the car and back to the house with all the groceries. I don't feel like I have time to put them away so they just stay on the stove until after she goes to bed.

We didn't spend much time outside today, and Noumena seems like she wants out of the house, so we head to the park.

* Park

Right as we arrive, she doesn't want to be let down immediately. Instead, I take her onto the platforms on the playground equipment and that's where she really starts cutting loose. She didn't seem to want to be alone, so I had down the slide a few times with her. She even ends up jumping into Daddy's arms from super high! We don't stay too long, however and head home.

* Bath Time

Getting Noumena ready for bath is a lot easier than yesterday. I tried to take my time and be much more careful when shampooing her hair and rinsing it out. I thought I did fine at rinsing out her hair, but I think she may have gotten some in her eye and she starts crying and really wants out. Because I'm so concerned about her since she's sick I don't take the time to clean her bath toys or even drain the tub. I usually also wrap her up in the towel after the tub is drained, but today, there's no time for that. I pick her right out of the tub just as wet as she is so I can comfort her as quickly as possible.

* Bed Time

She's calmed down after dressing her in her pajamas for the evening and when I bring her into her darkened bedroom, her head immediately collapses onto my chest. I really love how prepared she always is for bed time. I keep her against my chest for the duration of /Isn't She Lovely/ and switch to the cradle position when /Stand By Me/ comes on. At the end of that song, she's laying in my arms content but still has her eyes open and has not fallen asleep. When /Just The Two Of Us/ comes on, I gently sing along with the song and softly caress her face to soothe her to sleep. She jolts a few times while I'm holding her and every time she does her eyes open for a brief period. Each time, I assure her that I am still holding her and that I love her. Eventually she falls asleep and when I lay her down, she doesn't stir even a little bit.

Noumena, I'm so sorry you had such a hard time today, but I want you to know that I'm so proud of the way you handled yourself and how tough you are. You're the most beautiful, wonderful and strong girl I've ever seen and I'm so proud to be your father.

Good night, sweetheart. I love you so much I hope your dreams are vivid, wonderful and amazingly beautiful. I hope the prettiest owls come visit you in your sleep and let you pet them or even fly on them.

See you tomorrow, sweetheart.

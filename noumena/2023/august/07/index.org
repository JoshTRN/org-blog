* Morning

I had a nightmare last night. I can't remember what it was, but I woke up at 7am because of it. When I awoke, Noumena wasn't making any noises so I went back to sleep. I reawoke at 7:50am when my alarm went off and still no sounds from Noumena. I didn't get the time to make porridge yesterday, so overnight oats are going to have to do. She's going to have that tomorrow as well. In some ways I think that it's more filling than the porridge and I guess it's also good to mix it up. Noumena has a slight fever when she wakes up but it's much lower than yesterday. Like the previous days, I give her ibuprofen right when she wakes up and we let Chalmers out then have breakfast together. She's very easy going when getting her dressed today and we have to leave right when she gets dressed. When we arrive at daycare, I hand her directly to one of the workers and she immediately has no issues with me leaving her. My big strong girl doesn't even cry.

* Nap

Noumena fell asleep on the drive home pretty quickly. She wakes up when we arrive and I move her from her car seat, but I know she needs more rest so I lay her down in her crib and she falls asleep within a few minutes. I thought I'd give her 30 minutes to nap in addition to the 10 she slept in the car, but that apparently wasn't enough because when I went in there, touching her and softly saying her name did nothing to wake her from her slumber as it usually does. I really want to get her up so she doesn't have a hard time going to bed, but I just can't disturb her when she seems like she needs it so much.

* Dinner

I go in at 6:30pm dreading having to wake her up because I really don't want her to wake up if she's still needs rest. When I get in there, she doesn't spring awake but she does get up and roll around. She wants me to hold her. I'm glad I let her rest because she's in a good mood. I tried feeding her pasta and she didn't want any. I tried feeding her rice and she didn't want any. I tried feeding her a puree and she only ate a little. I even tried giving her a date and she only ate like half of it. She did drink a cup of soymilk though, so that's something.

I remember being the same way when I was sick as a kid. I didn't want to eat anything. Well, at least she's still eating a little bit.

* Park

I carried Noumena on my shoulders to the park. I realized a trick to getting her to relax when she's up there is just to mimic the sounds that she makes. We didn't stay very long because she wasn't interested at all in leaving my side. Normally she loves to adventure, but I think because she wasn't feeling 100%, it's just better to keep Daddy around. We go down the slide together a couple of times and I swing her for a while, but after about 15 minutes, we head back home and spend the rest of the evening there.

* Back At Home

It's 7:30pm when we get back home, so Noumena and I just wander around the house with one another. I can't remember why I put Noumena up on the bed, maybe because she was trying to get up there herself or because I chased her into the room, but once she's up there, she's loving me running around the bed and she tries to avoid me in the cutest ways possible whenever I get close to her which involves smashing her face into the mattress repeatedly.

I think Chalmers sees us messing around and gets hyped up. While Noumena is still on the bed he hops up and tries to wrestle with me, but I'm not going to do that with Noumena on the bed. She seems like she wants to watch me wrestle with him, though, so I set her on the floor next to the bed. She's just tall enough to see over the edge and she watches as Chalmers goes on the attack. Eventually, she wants to join the action, so I calm Chalmers down and bring her onto the bed with us.

Afterward, Chalmers is still amped and she totally loves it, so I make him chase us down the hall back and forth.

We eventually settle down and play in the living room.

* Bath Time

Tonight was another instance of Noumena not enjoying going into the bath at first, but it's still better than she was on Saturday. Once again, she's putting the foam letters on the wall, so that makes it a lot easier to wash the shampoo out. I give her Tylenol before brushing her teeth and feeding the pets with her.

* Bed time

We put on our playlist and initially I thought she was going to give me a hard time going to bed. She's not laying against my chest right away, but in her room in the dark eventually she does. We get through both /Isn't She Lovely/ and /Stand By Me/ before she closes her eyes though. I finish /Just The Two Of Us/ with Noumena fast asleep cradled in my arms. When I lay her down, she doesn't even make a sound. She's in a very deep sleep.

I'm sorry you're not feeling too well, my lovely baby girl. Daddy tries to make you feel better. You seem like you're getting better. I'll check on you tomorrow morning and see how you're feeling to make sure everything is alright.

Sleep tight, my precious baby.

* Morning

I went to bed late, so I didn't get out of bed until 8:30am and Noumena didn't disturb me at all. In fact she was still fast asleep when I went in there, so it was a shame to wake her up. Before waking her up, I prepared myself a cup of coffee, got our oatmeal ready with a cup of soy milk. When we're eating, she's eating a lot. I think she's making up for her reduced appetite from the previous days. I honestly hope she leaves me some!

Even though we're running late, I let her take her time with eating, but after we finish up, I get her dressed and ready to go right away. When I drop her off at daycare, I think since she's still not 100% she cries when I hand her over to the daycare worker. I know, baby girl. I wish I could spend all day with you as well.

* Park

I finish work a little early and so I wanted to go early to pick up Noumena. Her mother said she wanted to meet after Noumena got out of daycare, so I told her I was going to pick Noumena up early and she was to meet us at a nearby park we had discussed earlier.

When I arrive at Noumena's daycare, she's eating what looks like chex mix. She must have been really hungry, because when she sees me she doesn't even get up from her chair. She stares at me as she eats, but just keeps on eating. She's seated at a table with a few other kids, so I walk up to sit next to them. The new little girl who isn't used to me yet gets scared when I sit next to her across from Noumena at the table. She gets up and runs away crying to one of the workers. It's so cute. All the other kids are used to me by now, so they just give me high fives and babble at me while I talk to them. I want to go meet Noumena's mother, so I pack up her food to take with us, grab her and we head out the door.

It's a short four-minute ride to the park from the daycare. Mom is there when we arrive and I let her take Noumena out of her car seat. Mom first carries Noumena up to a statue at the park allowing her to investigate before we head to the playground to show Noumena a toy that Mommy got her. Noumena shows a little interest in the toy, but I think she's more interested in being around her parents and playing on the playground. She climbs on the platforms, gets up to the top and when she's up there, goes down the slide with Mommy.

Mom had prepared a peanut butter and jelly sandwich as well as brought fruit with her so we decided to sit down for a little picnic on the park benches. The benches awkwardly lined the sidewalk where you'd normally think they'd be situated under a gazebo or surrounded by trees in order to shade the area, especially since the benches were lined with a black coating likely retaining a lot of heat. Luckily, we found a shaded spot right at the end of the bench for us to eat at. Despite having already eaten, Noumena was munching down and that PB&J like there was no tomorrow. Noumena's less interested in the fruit while she's at the table and ends up throwing a few pieces on the ground. After she's done with the PB&J and wants to be let down, however, when she's on the ground, she regains interest in the fruit because of course it's now gained that special seasoning from the ground. She picks up a few and eats them, try to stop her as I may.

Shortly after, Mom leaves and we head home.

* Nap Time

Noumena falls asleep in the car just as we're arriving home. When I take her out of her car seat, she awakens as I'm taking her inside, but she seems so tired so I lay her down for a nap. She goes to sleep immediately at 5:45pm and I let her sleep for almost an hour waking her up at 6:40pm. I first give her the antibiotic she's scheduled for then give her some soymilk, but after that for some reason she's really whiny. She doesn't want to play with any of her toys and she doesn't want to read her books. She's whining about everything. I figured that maybe she wants to go to the park, but when I start walking down the street with her, she's whining about that. I finally give up and  think she must be tired. I brought her back home and let her sleep for another half hour until 7:30pm before she woke up herself.

* Hanging out At Home

When Noumena gets up, She's still whiny so I think she might be hungry. She eats a whole piece of buttered bread herself and also a lot of the black bean soup I had made for myself to eat. She was definitely hungry and that's usually what puts her in a better mood. Even after dinner, though, she was still in a bad mood. I tried everything to help out, but she just wasn't having a good time with anything.

Eventually I called my friend who has a baby so they could video chat with each other. The two barely interacted but Noumena was definitely transfixed with the phone and payed attention to the other baby for a very long time. This conversation eventually led us to the porch and surprisingly we suffered very few mosquito bites. I see if Chalmers wants to be out there with us and he hangs out before I conclude that it's a horrible idea and put him back inside. We talked with out friends all the way until bath time.

* Bath/Bed Time

Bath time is more of a pseudo bath time today. Since she was so fussy, I knew she wasn't going to want to take a bath and definitely wouldn't stand for being shampooed. I didn't clean her very thoroughly because she wouldn't have liked it, I more just rinsed her off and even then she didn't really enjoy that. In fact the only way I got her to stop being whiny was to put her foam letters in my mouth and act like a dog. This puts a smile on her face, but it's not long before she's no longer amused. I let her take all the time she needed, not rushing her at all just to make sure she was comfortable. When I pulled her out of the bath, it was almost bed time. I quickly got her dressed in her pajamas, brushed her teeth and we went straight into the bedroom.

As is typical for Noumena, the moment the light is off in her room, her head collapses against my chest. This time, when /Isn't She Lovely/ starts, Noumena is singing a long. It's truly a beautiful sound. She's asleep at the end of the song, but I hold her against my chest until /Stand By Me/ has finished playing. I lay her down without fuss for the night.


Noumena, I'm sorry you had such a rough time tonight. I wonder what was wrong. Perhaps you didn't nap enough today at daycare. I don't know. I love you though. I'm going to try to make sure everything goes great for you tomorrow!

I love you, sweetie. I hope you have a wonderful, restful slumber.

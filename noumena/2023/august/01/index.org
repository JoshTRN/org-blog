* Morning

I woke up at 7am this morning and didn't really feel tired at all. I wanted to get some writing done, so it was good I woke up a little early. It also means I have time to get ready without any pressure from Noumena or time pressure, which is relieving. If I weren't so tired all the time, I would always wake up this early! I prepare some coffee, finish it, and then when it's about time to wake Noumena up, I warm her porridge. Noumena is awake at about 7:30am when I go in there to wake her up, but she gave no indication prior to me going in there that she was awake.

When approaching Noumena crib, she stays laying down, which is different than her usual behavior. Usually, she's quick to stand and often throws her blanked over the edge of the crib. This is not so in today's case. She remains laying in the crib and starts kicking like she's about to throw a tantrum. Because I want to avoid tantrums before they start, I reach down and pick her up.

I had already let Kisa outside, but not Chalmers, so with Noumena in hand, I open the front door and attach Chalmers to his leash before sitting down with Noumena to eat. Once we finish the porridge, we let Chalmers in and I sit with Noumena a bit to play with her on my lap again so as to avoid her throwing a fit. Shortly thereafter, when she's already spent some time calm, I take her to get dressed and she gives me no problems. We leave for daycare at about 8:30am, so I got to spend a good amount of time with Noumena this morning---more than usual.

* 15 Month Pediatrician Appointment
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 15-mo-pediatrician-appointment
:END:

Yesterday, I scheduled a pediatrician appointment for 1pm today so I leave home about 12:30pm to pick Noumena up from daycare and take her to her 15 month regular visit. I don't know how, but it somehow slipped my mind that she was supposed to see the doctor at 15 months. I thought her next appointment wasn't until 18 months. The reason I thought I should go in is because she's at 15 months, so all my googling about tantrums recently was about that age, and I kept reading about their traditional 15 month appointments. I'm tempted to use the adage about black clouds and silver linings, but I don't actually view the tantrums as black clouds. I appreciate this stage of development and am very patient about it. In any case, I'm grateful for them in an unsuspecting way because those tantrums made sure I got her to her 15 month appointment.

I told Mom about it last night and asked her if she wanted to meet us there for the appointment and she agreed, so when we arrive Mom is already there and greets Noumena with open arms carrying her into the pediatric facility. Noumena is weighed first and for the first time on the big kids scale. She's 20.2lbs! And when we get back to the room, her height is measured and she's 30" tall! That's 2Â½ foot tall! Noumena's pediatrician, Ms. Ashley, asks a few questions about her diet and habits, checks her out and gives her standard advice about rear-facing car seats, choking hazards etc. We're told she's perfectly normal and there are no health concerns. I always wanted to save her height and weight metrics but I never knew how I'd do it. Now that I have this blog, I can do it here.

Unfortunately we're informed that Noumena has to get vaccines this time! I thought that she was going to need them at 18 months, but once again I was mistaken. She needs to get 2 now. She gets 2 vaccines: DTaP (Diptheria, Tetnus, Pertussis) and Pneumococcal Conjugate vaccines. We opt to get them both in the same leg. There are 2 reasons we want the same leg. Firstly, it will be faster, so she well be in less pain, and secondly, I feel like I'd rather have one slightly bigger spot of pain on one limb than 2 slightly smaller spots of pain on 2 limbs.

Noumena gets the shots and Mommy comforts her after 2 bandages are applied. Shortly after, she wants Daddy as we're walking out so I comfort her too. She stops crying very quickly. She's such a tough girl; I'm so proud of her. We get in the car and I take Noumena back to daycare informing them that she just got vaccinated, so to be on the lookout if she's cranky.

* Home

When I pick Noumena up, she's got a huge smile on her face and she's already excited to see me! I run at her and grab her up. They tell me that she was wonderful despite the vaccines. She falls asleep on our way home and I take a quick break in the car so she can rest up. She wakes up naturally at about 5:45pm and we head into the house.

The first thing I do aside from getting Noumena ibuprofen for her leg is let Chalmers outside since I had forgotten to do that. But then, all to avoid tantrums, the first thing I do--instead of preparing dinner--is sit on the ground with her books she loves so much, find the bird book with the owl in it and prompt her to say "owl". It's the only word she really knows so she says it about a hundred times as she's reading and ties to put the box meant to contain the books on her head as a hat. Once she's ready to be independent, I let Chalmers in. She plays with him while I warm our soup. She eats with no problems and is much better than yesterday. I think prevention of tantrums is the best strategy at this age.

After a little while of playing around, I called Chris on the phone. I got him into a video chat so he could see what she's referring to when she says "owl." Through the duration of the call, she says it maybe a million times. I hand her the phone and she walks around talking to Chris. It's a very cute sight.

Just before leaving to go to the park, I want to make sure she's got the right pajamas on tonight, so I do a small load of laundry knowing that I'll dry it when we get back home.

* Park

When traveling to the park, I decide that I'm going to leave my headset behind so there are no distractions from Noumena. As we walk, whenever Noumena makes a noise while riding atop my shoulders, I mimic the noise back to her just a little bit louder. This keeps her in a good mood for the walk and there's no whinging or flailing which is exactly what I was going for. I think it may just pay to be more engaged than I have been recently.

When we arrive, there are three sisters there with their dad. Initially, he's sitting down at the benches, but I think after he sees our daughters playing together and me playing with them, it motivates him to get up and start playing with his daughters more closely. This isn't the first time I've noticed this phenomenon. I think it really speaks to our sociability. I think when parents see other parents do well, it helps them model good behavior.

She's taken with the small slide at about 8pm when it's about time to go home. So I provide a countdown. I yell "3 more times and then we're getting out of here!" And count down as she goes the remaining times. I think she's going to throw a fit as we're leaving, but thankfully when I get her atop my shoulders, she's fine. She's good all the way back home. This is despite having gotten those shots earlier.

* Back Home

We listened to /Neurotica/ by Polyphia on the way back and /ABC/ by Polyphia starts auto playing. I put it on the speaker and leave her on my shoulders the whole time we listen to it dancing around in the house. I forgot to put the laundry in the dryer right as we got home, but I remembered at about 8:17pm when I looked at the clock, so we add the clothes in. I'm a little worried that they won't be dry after she gets out of the bath but not really. There are already dried clothes in the dryer from when I forgot to fold the last ones and there are so few clothes I'm pretty sure they will be dry by then.

We dance around listening to /Parrhesia/ by Animals as Leaders and listen to that through bath time. At some point, I want to vacuum. At first Noumena doesn't seem to mind, then she starts chasing me around while I'm vacuuming trying to throw a fit which is very funny. Eventually, she persuades me to pick her up so I finish vacuuming with her in my arms. We go to bath time late because I'm paranoid about the dryer. Once the bath is over, it's about 8:50pm, so I change her diaper first then check the dryer. Thankfully the clothes are dry, so I put Noumena in her pajamas and we finish up our bed time routine.


Noumena falls asleep in my arms as I shower her with kisses. At some point when I hold her close, I feel so in love with her, I sob a little letting out a cry while say out loud in the dark as I cradle her "I love my daughter so much." These emotions often overwhelm me.

I love you, Noumena.

Good night, my precious baby.

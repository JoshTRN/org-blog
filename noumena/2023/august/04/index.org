* Morning

Waking up, I can tell that Noumena is already awake. She's not fussing or anything, but I can definitely tell she's moving around and making some noise. It's 8am and I'm so grateful that Noumena is letting me sleep in in the mornings. I get my coffee and Noumena's porridge ready and we eat together. Once again, since I woke up a little later, we have to get Noumena dressed right away and we have to head to daycare.

* Daycare

When we arrive at daycare, I brought her Desitin with her because of her diaper rash. I ask the teacher there if she can apply it and she says yes after I sign a form allowing them to do it. I hope they applied it.

Today is the final water day of the year at Noumena's daycare. I totally forgot to bring Noumena in her swim suit. Thankfully, they have some clothes there that look swim suit-ish so I tell them they can just put her in those.

When I pick Noumena up, we have a whole mess of things to carry back to the car. There are the clothes Noumena wore for water day, a pair of dirty shorts of 2 pieces of art they had forgotten to give to me when she made them, her sheet, and a cookie they gave to her. I can't take the cookie out of the package before we get to the car because my hands are full, and she realizes it's edible and sweet before we get to the car, so she starts chewing on it through its plastic packaging crumbling it to pieces before getting to taste any of it. After I set her into the car seat, I grab one of the larger pieces of cookie and hand it to her to eat on the way home.

My whole life, I've never been a sentimental person. Noumena is the exception to this rule. Tomorrow while we're going grocery shopping I'll see if there are frames that can accommodate the picture sizes and if there are, I will buy them to hang on the wall. Even though she wasn't fully aware what she was doing when making these pieces of art, they're invaluable to me and I'll be damned before I ever lose them.

The soccer ball has a date on it, so I'll add this picture to the July 20th post also.

* Dinner
Getting back from the house, the first thing that I do is throw all those clothes and that sheet into the washing machine along with any of our other dirty laundry. It's a little tough managing Noumena right when we get home. Nevertheless, I enjoy it more now than when she first started throwing tantrums. I'm not sure what exactly it is, but she is very needy right when we get home and it's somewhat of a mystery why. I give her soy milk to drink right when we arrive and she seems to like that. I made pasta because it doesn't require me to be present the entire time, so I can take care of Noumena while it cooks. I'm gonna have to figure out some new quick and easy recipes since she's tired of that soup.

The wash is done before Noumena finishes eating, so I throw the clothes into the dryer before taking her out of her high chair.

* Playing At Home

Noumena ate a lot of pasta as well as a good amount of soymilk so much so that you can see her full stomach sticking very far out and it's very cute. She is not too fussy when I clean her off and after doing so cleaning her tray, she's not exactly in the best mood. Since throwing away trash is a very enjoyable activity to Noumena, I take the wipes I used to clean her and her tray down, and throw them on the ground, handing the first one to her in hopes that she'll enjoy herself. She does indeed making her pretty easy to handle thereafter.

 Didn't take her to the park right away because it was very cloudy today, but it looks like it's clearing up at about 7pm, so I strap her into the car seat. Remembering that I had forgotten to take her Desitin back from the daycare, I know I have to get more. We make a quick detour to Harvey's, the grocery store near by, and then back to the house because I don't want her playing without that protective coating on her private parts. I'm glad we make this detour though even though it cuts into the time we have at the park a little. we leave at 7:15pm and get there about 7:20pm.

* Park

We're all alone at the park today, which is nice even though I'd probably rather there be lots of kids there for Noumena to play with preferably ones she's familiar with. It'd probably due to the fact that it had rained that no one wanted to take their kids there. Surprisingly, the slides didn't have any water pooled on them, which I found strange. Although, it is true that these slides get a lot of direct sun light.

At some point, Noumena does some really crazy stuff. Being the daredevil that she is, she sizes up whether or not she can take the jump from the platform that's lead to by a chain ladder to the ground. Of course, she can't do it on her own. At first she wants me to hold her hands, but instead I hold them just below her torso prompting her to lean down and eventually jump into my arms. She does jump into my arms. She does this 3 times. She's absolutely crazy. I begin to worry if she's going to try these stunts when I'm not really close to make sure she's safe, but I'm not too worried. She does appear to size up the risks before taking them, so I'm fairly confident she'll be fine. Still, I'm raising a wildling that's for sure.

* Before Bed

Getting back from the park at 8pm, Noumena is starting to get fussy again and understandably so. She's is a very tired little girl. Not only that, but she had another liquidy bowel movement at the park. That's why I'm glad I put that Desitin on before we went. The first thing I do to make her comfortable is take her shoes off and when I change her diaper I do the minimal effort I can get away with to avoid irritating her rash. After all, bath time is coming soon. We sit together after drinking a little soymilk to read together. We get through 4 books consecutively! She really enjoyed reading tonight. It's about 8:15pm and I remember the laundry I had thrown in right when we got home. I take that out, Noumena helps me fold it and after I put it all away, it's about time to take a bath.

* Bath Time

During Noumena's bath, she's gotten into the habit of drinking the water out of her toys. Her bath toys are little cups with holes in the bottom for water to get through, but she uses them like any normal person would use a cup. I let her do it for a little while without rinsing the shampoo out of her hair because I don't want her drinking the shampoo. The bath water without that is still gross, but if it makes her happy I guess it's okay.

She's gotten over the letters that get stuck to the wall, so she doesn't try that anymore. Thankfully there's still a strategy to wash the shampoo out---when she tilts her head back to drink from that cup, I can rinse her hair then. That's what I do, rather successfully.

I worry about cleaning her private area because of the rash, so I try to do it as quickly and gently as possible. When I do clean her, she does start crying, but the crying is a little delayed as compared to yesterday and it's certainly not as dramatic as yesterday signifying to me that although still bad, it's getting better.

* Bed Time

After getting Noumena's teeth brushed, she helps me feed the pets as usual. Kisa won't come inside, so I just leave her out there and Noumena and I head to bed. We begin listening to /Isn't She Lovely/ by Stevie Wonder and she collapses against my chest. Her arms are totally limp to her side and her head is against my chest and I feel so close to her. She falls asleep within a minute. I lay her back into my arms and cradle her while the song finishes and listen to /Stand By Me/ before laying her into her crib.


I love you, Noumena. Good night, sweet heart. I'm glad tomorrow we get to spend all day together and I'm going to try to find really cool and fun stuff for us to do together!

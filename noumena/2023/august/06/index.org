* Morning

Noumena woke up at 7:30am today and there was no question that she needed to get up right away. Usually I've been seeing if she'll sleep in, but today it was unmistakable. I prepared her porridge and we ate together after first giving her ibuprofen to reduce her fever. I could tell to the touch she wasn't as hot as yesterday, so I see that as progress, but she was definitely still warm. She's pretty easy to handle this morning thankfully, but I decide I'm going to take her to urgent care just to be safe.

* Urgent Care

The sickness has really worn Noumena out. She falls asleep on the way to urgent care, and unfortunately I have to wake her up when we arrive. When we get inside, she's an angel sitting on Daddy's knee while Daddy fills out paperwork. She's just totally content with me there. Eventually they bring us back and have her stand on the scale. She doesn't want to stand by herself, so they weigh her by first weighing me without her and then weighing me with her. She's 20.2 lbs the same as on Monday when she was weighed at the pediatrician.

They check her temperature and she is not happy about that at all. In fact, she absolutely hates it, so I have to hold her arms while they violate her personal space. I insist on a covid test just to make sure she doesn't have it and it comes back negative. At first, the doctor said it was something viral, but after taking the covid test and seeing that her mucus was green, they prescribed an antibiotic just in case. When we're headed home, she falls asleep again.

When we get home, I have to wake her up to get out of the car seat, but I know that she'll go back to sleep. I try to rock her to sleep in her room, but I think since I'm there she wants to spend time with me so she resists. I know Noumena is tired though, so I lay her down in her crib. Sure enough, she cries for less than a minute before going down for a nap. It's really super early for her nap, but it's okay. I take a nap also.


* Being Lazy At Home

We spend most of the day at home. Oksana advised me not to take Noumena to the park since she's sick, so I don't. I normally discourage the use of the TV, but given that Noumena is sick, I think it's an appropriate time. After all, when she wakes up from her nap she is not feeling too well. It's too early to give her ibuprofen again and she's not running a fever anyway, so we just watch Sesame Street for a while.

Eventually, I get a text saying that Noumena's prescription is ready, so we head to the pharmacy. I totally ran out of coffee creamer too, so It gives me an excuse to get some red bull to get caffeine in my body. The doctor also told me that I could use both acetaminophen and ibuprofen, so we pick some of that up as well as some crackers since the doctor told me I should feed her crackers to help with her bowel movements. She also said no dairy products... If only she knew.

I lay Noumena down for a nap at around 2pm. She is still doing that thing where she wants to stay awake with me, but you can just tell she's tired. I laid  her down and she went right to sleep again. This is good, it will give me to prepare some dinner for us later. Noumena ends up sleeping for 3 whole hours. She would have slept more if I let her, but I have to wake her up at 5pm, so she gets to sleep at 9pm without issue.

* Dinner

For dinner I made us a teriyaki stir fry. The main reason is I wanted to get her some vegetables with her rice. Sadly, Noumena only ate the rice. She wasn't much into the teriyaki. I have no idea why. It was really good and I saved some for later. Perhaps if I give it to her without the rice at first she'll like it. Who knows? I will try to give it to her again tomorrow.

* Publix

After hanging out a while at home, I'm getting stir crazy because I didn't take Noumena to the park today. I think she's getting bored of the house as well, so I change her diaper and we head to Publix. I honestly only went there for one thing and that was dates because I know how Noumena loves them so much. I'm glad I did though because I was reminded that I needed mangoes for her porridge---and honestly just to eat because mangoes are so amazingly tasty---as well as soymilk. Noumena enjoys being at the store with me. Honestly, she was super needy all day today and to tell you the truth I absolutely loved it. Not that I want her to be sick, but there is definitely a silver lining to it.

I used to tell Noumena's mother when she asked if I ever got tired of Noumena being so needy---Some day, sooner than it should, it's no longer going to be the case that the only thing that can calm her down and make her feel better is me holding her. That day is right around the corner and when it comes, although it will be replaced with brand new experiences and challenges with Noumena that will make me proud to be a father, I will miss the days when me simply cuddling my little girl was the only thing that would make her feel right.

* Evening

Our evening is the same as our day, except no TV. But we're doing nothing but reading and she's wandering around asking for soymilk periodically. I give it to her every time, of course.

* Bath/Bed time

Before bath time, I enlist Noumena's help cleaning up the living room. She's not super helpful, but we get the job done. Once again, she's resistant to the bath. I'm not sure why she doesn't like it when she's sick, but she's better adapted to it than she was yesterday, making it easier to clean her. She also did the thing where she sticks the foam letters to the side of the bath today which made it super easy to rinse the shampoo out.

Brushing Noumena's teeth is a different story, though. I'm not sure what it is, but she does not like it today. I'm pretty sure I got all the teeth, but she certainly didn't make it easy and I definitely was not as thorough as I usually am.

I lament the fact that these days will end as I hold Noumena against my chest and dance with her as she falls asleep. Every single hug she gives me feels so precious and like I never want it to end, so I greatly cherish these times when I'm able to hug her for extended periods as she falls asleep. I truly, honestly, can't think of any greater feeling than being loved by her. She melts my heart every single time she holds me and the fact that it's so mundane to her is precious to me.

Noumena, I love you so much. Good night, sweet heart. I hope you feel better in the morning.

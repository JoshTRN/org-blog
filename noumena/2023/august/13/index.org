* Morning

Noumena woke up super late today. I'm not actually sure if she was laying awake in her crib for a long time without making noises. It's interesting that she's gotten to a point where when she wakes up she basically doesn't cry at all. She's totally fine just sitting in there by herself. What's funny about that is when I lay her in the crib, she hates it. She knows it's nap time or I'm going to spend time without her and she'll miss me or miss running around when I lay her down and she doesn't want it. But, waking up is a whole new story these days. When she wakes she's doesn't even make noise. I'm not sure how she's not bored, but it allows me to sleep which is really helpful.

I get out of bed at 8:30am and prepare Noumena's porridge as well as my coffee. Noumena's mother calls because we planned to go to the beach with Noumena. She comes over and we get Noumena dressed and head to the beach!

* Beach Day

On the way to the beach, Noumena's mom applies sun screen so she's ready to go when we get there. It's early so we find parking fast. Noumena and Mommy walk to the water as we arrive and I finish putting sun screen on my self.

Noumena is not at all nervous about the water. She's so confident she's running into it having the time of her life running back and forth. I love her so much it makes me so happy watching her enjoy herself.

There was another little girl just 18 days older than Noumena we saw there. Noumena was interested in her, so we tried to introduce them to one another, but she was very nervous around me. It was quite a funny thing to see.

Noumena and I chased birds, ran in the water and swam a little together. We went deeper into the ocean than we ever went. The water was never above my waist when standing, but I would kneel down and submerge myself to my chest while holding Noumena. I would stand when there were particularly big waves coming, but I wasn't 100% successful in keeping the water out of Noumena's face when the waves came.

We stay there for a little over an hour, and get Noumena dressed in the shade as we're exiting the beach. On the way home, Noumena falls asleep, but she doesn't get the opportunity to sleep all that long.

* Lunch

It's about 12:30pm when we get home and Mom leaves as I get Noumena's lunch ready. I didn't have anything ready except leftover tofu scramble, so Noumena is going to have to settle for that for lunch.

We run around the living room a little bit, but I know that Noumena didn't sleep enough on the car ride back, so at 1:30pm, I lay her in her crib for a nap. Once again, I tried to rock her to sleep, but should wouldn't have it, so I just laid her in her crib and within a few minutes she passed out. While Noumena naps, I cook a vegetable soup and talk to a friend on the phone while I'm doing it.

* Home after Nap

She did that thing again where she wasn't whining when she woke up. Instead, I knew she was up because she was banging on the walls and her crib. When I get her out and set her down, call Chalmers into her room and we just start playing with her toys right away.

* Dinner

After a little while, I recall that I made dinner and had put a bowl of vegetable soup inside the freezer to cool down just before I went into her room so I feed her that. To my surprise, she eat a lot!

While she's eating, she points to the owls and I start saying I don't see any owls anywhere so she keeps pointing and saying it. It's a great game and she seems to love playing it.

* Relaxing At Home

Noumena was super easy going today. We just hung out in the living room for a good chunk of the day after she finished her food.

I got a very special clip out of that last video of Noumena just turning around to say "hi" that is so adorable.

We hang out in the living room until after 6pm. I wanted to stay inside because of the heat, but in the evening when it cooled down, I wanted to take her to the park.

* Park

I knew I wanted to go to the park before I knew which park I wanted to go to. I put Noumena in the car to head out, but when I was strapping her in she grabbed her water bottle, but smashed it into her nose and hurt herself. I grabbed her out of her seat and comforted her, but even though it looked like it really hurt, she was comfortable in a few moments. My little girl is really resilient!

I decide to go to Riverside park because we haven't gone there in a while and they have a great playground plus I want to take Noumena to less familiar places. When we get there, we get on the big kids playground and run around on the bridge together. I would have let her run on it herself, but her leg could fit between the platform the bridge was attached to and the bridge itself, so I wouldn't let her do it on her own. There's a little kids playground very close so we head there and I let her jump on the bridge herself.

While Noumena and I play, a little boy arrives and I picked up his name, Noah, and starts running around. He looks like he's maybe 3 years old. Noumena is fascinated by him and watches him run around joining him here and there. Whenever Noah sees Noumena and me doing something he wants to do he says, "me turn" and starts trying to do it with us it's very cute and funny. I didn't bring any water with us and Noumena has been totally leaking sweat so we go to the corner store nearby before heading home and I sit her atop the car and fill her water bottle so she can drink it on the way home.

* Back At Home

When we get home, it's about 8:00pm, and since we ate dinner earlier than usual and I didn't eat dinner with her, I make myself a bowl of soup and some sour dough bread with butter and sit her down to eat with me. She doesn't eat much, but that's okay. I'm just happy she's full enough. I wouldn't want her going to bed hungry. Then I give her a date and see her trying to tempt Chalmers into chasing her.

Before giving Noumena a bath, I get my blankets out of the drying machine and start applying them to the bed. Noumena for some reason seems really possessive over my pillow and I have no idea why, but it's very funny. I give her a hard time about it a couple times just to catch it on film.

After I finish applying the bed sheets, it's bath time.

* Bath Time

During bath time, I do better with the new shampoo, but it's definitely a little worse than the other one because even though I was more careful, she still had some irritation in her eyes. I never really play with her toys with her in the bath. I always am just focused on getting her clean. Today, I got the idea to play with her shark and have it bite her.

We didn't start the bath until 8:35pm and we didn't end until 8:50pm, so when I get her in her pajamas and brush her teeth it's already 8:56pm, so right after brushing her teeth, I don't feed the pets with her and just take her right to bed.

* Bed Time

While I was holding Noumena, listening to /Stand By Me/ I kiss her before laying her down to sleep.

Noumena was really out of it, so I thought for sure she would go down really easily, but when I actually laid her down, I think maybe she had that falling sensation and moved a little and didn't enjoy it when I laid her in her crib.

Sorry you didn't have the best time falling asleep, Noumena, but we had so much fun today and I was so in love with you so many times during the day. I will always look fondly at these memories with you. You can't tell right now, but someday you'll know how just looking at you makes me tear up from the love pouring out of me for you.

Good night, sweet baby. I will see you in the morning!

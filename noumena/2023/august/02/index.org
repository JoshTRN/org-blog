* Morning

On my phone, I have set a daily alarm for 7:55am. Usually, I wake up or Noumena wakes me up before it goes off. Not today. Today this alarm wakes me up And I end up hitting snooze until 8:05am when I make myself get out of bed. I'm not sure why Noumena has become so easy going in the mornings, but it's greatly appreciated as it allows me to catch up on sleep pretty well. I get ready and warm Noumena's porridge before getting her out of her crib. When I get in there, she's awake. She's just being well behaved in her crib. I didn't even hear her making noise. I thought I would be waking her up! I carry Noumena to the door to let Chalmers out and we enjoy porridge together. After eating, we let Chalmers in, and I get her dressed right away because we're running a little late this morning and we head to daycare.

* Home

Noumena's mother asked if she could stop by to use our washing machine and I said yes. When we get home, Noumena is greeted by her mother. I prepare Noumena's soup and Mom made a sweet potato. Noumena eats the soup, some sweet potato and a date as well as soymilk for dinner.

Mom hangs out and plays with Noumena until her laundry is done drying. Noumena helps fold Mom's laundry and shortly after Mom leaves.

We hang out at home for a little while longer before heading to the park.

* Park Far Away

[[file:rocking-at-the-playground.jpg]]

I wanted to go to a different park today, so I strapped Noumena in and we went for a ride. The daycare app reported that she basically only napped for an hour which is definitely not enough and she didn't nap at all on the drive home. Admittedly, even if she had napped on the way home, it wouldn't have been long enough to be significant. She would have probably at most slept 5 minutes. And, it's about 7pm when we leave for the park so she's definitely tired. As I predicted, she falls asleep on the way, but she only got to sleep for about 3 minutes because we arrived at the park so soon after she started to sleep and I wasn't going to let her sleep this late because that would make bed time more difficult.


Thankfully, when we arrive she's not too upset that she's waking up after getting so little to sleep. We see a little boy and a little girl swinging on the swings as we arrive. They're siblings. I take Noumena to the playground and the little boy comes up to me and asks if we want to play with him. I say sure, but he wants to play tag and I tell him I can't be running around with Noumena unsupervised. His sister comes over and I ask them their names. His name is Royce and her name is Ryanne (totally guessing at how to spell that). It's pronounced rye- like the bread and anne. They want to go down the slide as a train with me and Noumena so we agree to do that. Noumena and I can't really fit around them, so we just follow them down. I then prompt Noumena to chase them around and she does a little bit. At some point, they wanted to jump from one slide to the next, so I help Ryanne do that the first time, but then she's brave enough to do it herself! Her brother is a little too scared to do it even though I told him I'd help him. It's a lot of fun playing with them, and when they leave they ask if they can come back tomorrow and we can try the slide thing again.

After, Noumena wants to get on the rocking toy (I have no idea what you'd call this thing) and makes the cutest faces in the world while she's on it. I'm so happy I got them on film

When it's approaching 7:30pm, there's a corner store near by and I didn't bring water, so I pop Noumena on my shoulders and we head there. We buy a water and I give it to her to drink as we head back to the car. I'm not sure what inspired me to do this, but I plop her on top of my car and it's really cute to me for some reason.

* Home Again

Noumena didn't fall asleep on the way home, thankfully. I was worried she might because of how tired she has to be. We get back at around 8pm, I turn on the music and Noumena starts dancing to it. It's so cute I absolutely have to get it on video.

We make our way around the house, and finally.... FINALLY I catch Noumena in "the pose." I'm been trying to get this picture for months, and the stars finally aligned and I got it.

After that, we hangout on the bed with Chalmers until it's Noumena's bath time. Although I like hanging out on the bed with her, she always worries me. She's totally ready to take a tumble off the side of the bed because she's such a daredevil, but it is absolutely one of the cutest things every to watch her face-plant over and over into the pillows or onto the bed.

* Bed Time

As is typical, Noumena falls asleep right away. Even though she's asleep, I can't help but hold her longer. I hold her until 9:05pm before laying her into her crib.

We had fun today, Noumena. I can't wait to see what tomorrow has in store for us.

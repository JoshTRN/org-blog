* Morning

Today, Noumena's mother wanted to come over to give Noumena some of the owl-themed toys she'd bought on Amazon after realizing that Noumena's favorite animal is an owl. Noumena is still sleeping when her mother arrives and her mom asks me if she can go in and wake her up. Of course, I say she can. Mom, Chalmers and I all go in to bid Noumena good morning. Upon seeing us, Noumena rolls over and reaches her hands out as she runs towards the side of the crib that I'm on signifying she wants me to take her out of her crib. I do and then hand her to Mommy. I had already prepared a bowl of porridge for Noumena and me to share and a cup of coffee for myself, but first things first, Noumena is to receive her gifts.

Encased in the three Amazon packages were three separate gifts: a beanie baby owl, a book that we read several times today called /Where's The Owl/ and some pajamas. Mommy sits on the couch setting Noumena on her lap, picking up the packages in succession to open each one revealing the gifts inside. Having trouble with one package, Daddy's help is enlisted to open it. I happily oblige.

As Noumena's mother reads her the book containing felt flaps concealing various animals and the final concealing a mirror, Noumena pays close attention. Shortly afterward, Noumena and I eat porridge together. After breakfast, her mother takes the opportunity to dress her in today's outfit and heads out. We follow shortly after to head to daycare.

* Evening

I arrive at 5:15pm to pick Noumena up from daycare and we head straight home, arriving there about 10 minutes later. Having parked the car and removed Noumena from her car seat, I set her on the trunk of the vehicle. I imagined her running up the rear windshield before jumping off into my arms; however, once atop the trunk, all Noumena wanted was to be in Daddy's arms. I picked her up and carried her into the house.

Initially, I intended on playing for a little while before preparing dinner. Noumena, being accustomed to eating right away, has a different agenda, however. As I make my way to the kitchen, she trails behind me and soon begins to whine at the refrigerator while tugging at its door. It becomes clear that I'm not going to get away with not feeding her immediately.

Scooping her into my arms, I open the refrigerator door, take out the remaining soup and begin heating it in the microwave in the same meal prep container in which it was stored. With the knowledge that she's going to want buttered bread with our soup, I grab a plate, plop her butt onto the stove, deftly untangle the bread bag, pull out a couple slices, placing them on the plate. Noticing the bread on the plate, Noumena reaches down and grabs one taking a bite as I lather butter on the other slice. The soup is done when the bread is buttered, so I place Noumena in her high chair and we begin dinner.

After dinner, Noumena and I play in the living room for a bit, but it slowly becomes apparent that she's rather disinterested in toys. Slight groans emerge from her periodically revealing her growing dissatisfaction. Seeing this, I know what it will take to brighten her spirits. I take off running down the hall, Noumena follows behind. Once in the bedroom, When Noumena comes to one side of the bed, I jump onto it, roll over to the other side and hide. Between this and wrestling on the bed, her mood becomes much brighter.

I was hesitant to take Noumena to the park as the cloud coverage appeared quite dense. I ultimately chose to take the risk of being rained on. I strap on Noumena's shoes and we head out the door on the way to the park.

We're alone at the park today. Surprisingly, Noumena hasn't reached for any trash on the ground. Rather, she seemed content to remain on the playground equipment. After much effort in luring Noumena to the platform I want her to jump from, having secured the phone to record, I end up getting Noumena to take a half-hearted leap into Daddy's arms! She's trusts me so much and it's so much fun having her take these risks with the discernment not to when Daddy's not close by to catch her.

On the way back, we see some chickens so I let her down to chase after them. They run away rather quickly, however, leaving Noumena to play in the grass.

We frequently see a neighborhood dog when we walk by and on this occasion, since Noumena's gotten so good at waving her hand during greetings, I say "hi" to the dog several times while she waves. The dog's owners come up and say that she's an extremely nice dog. I pet the dog and allow Noumena to do so as well. We head home shortly thereafter.

* Home From Park

It's always a bit of a fascinating mystery the type of mild creativity that comes from playing with children. When we get home, Noumena finds a shoe that she had left on the ground after one of her previous home excursions. Instinctively, I put it on my head when she hands it to me, completely unaware of what struck the impulse. Unexpectedly, this playful gesture evolves into a game.

Noumena removes the shoe at first, struggles to place it back on my head for a short while until eventually successful and then repeats the cycle.

When the game finishes, we pick up the book her mother gave her today, reading through it several times with Noumena fully engaged in the project.

* Bed Time

Just after bath time but right before bed, after brushing Noumena's teeth, I notice that when she waves she makes an utterance that sounds distinctively like "hi" when waving at herself in the mirror. I prompt her several times to say "hi" and wave again, only succeeding in getting her to do so a single time before she's bored of it.

Upon taking her into her room with the lights out, before our playlist even begins, she's resting her head against my shoulder. She will be going to sleep very easily tonight. Unlike her usual, characteristic quiet groans during the onset of sleep, tonight she remains completely silent. Between all the wrestling, running around and home, and jumping at the park, she must be totally tuckered out.

We get through /Isn't She Lovely/ before I cradle her. As /Stand By Me/ plays and her white-noise machine begins its soothing hum on its 9pm schedule, I lay her down and she goes to sleep right away.

Tomorrow's Friday, Noumena! That means one more day until the weekend and we're going to have so much fun!

You are my everything, Noumena and I will try every single day to make sure you know that. Good night, precious baby. Sweet dreams.

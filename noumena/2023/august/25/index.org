* Morning

Once again Noumena let me sleep in. But today I think she actually woke me up making noises. I think it's a good sign because it means she is needing less sleep, so she's probably feeling quite a bit better. Before I go in to grab her, I get our oatmeal out ready to eat out on the table and a cup of soymilk in case she's thirsty. Noumena's appetite is back in full force and she eats a lot of oatmeal which is good. I load the oatmeal with protein powder because I eat it too, so her eating lots makes me feel like she's meeting her nutritional needs. We let Chalmers out, then get dressed and it's time to go. It's almost 8:45pm when we leave the house so we're running late.

* Nap

When I pick Noumena up from school, she's not too antsy in the car. In fact, within 5 minutes she falls asleep on the ride home. Even when I'm bringing her in the house, she rests her head against my chest, so I carry her to her room to lay her down for a nap. It's about 5:40pm when I turn on her noise machine and lay her in her crib. She makes a brief fuss and then goes straight to sleep. I don't wake her until 6:30pm.

* Dinner

I was so worried all day about what to feed Noumena for dinner because I didn't have time to cook, but her napping directly after daycare gave me opportunity to make some lentil pasta. I had purchased some spicy Italian beyond sausage and mixed that in with the sauce.

Thinking the sausage was relatively mild, I thought it would be fine for Noumena to eat it. I think I was wrong in this assessment. She didn't seem to want the pasta either because it was coated in the spicy sauce or due to the fact that it was red lentil pasta and she'd never had that before. In any case, she loved the green beans and since wasn't eating the pasta, I basically let her eat all of the green beans. Concerned that Noumena wouldn't get enough to eat, I grabbed out one of the puree pouches to feed her.

* Play time at home

For a very short time after dinner, maybe 30 minutes, we play with her toys in the living room, and for some reason Noumena was goofing around in the kitchen.

Even though it's late, at around 7:30pm, I still haven't taken Noumena outside, so I want to do that before she goes to sleep. I decide to take her to the park.

* Playing With Neighbor

Right as we exit, I see our neighbor's mother Miss Theresa, and her great grand baby Jeremiah. Jeremiah is only a month older than Noumena and they've basically known each other since she was born. Maybe a little after she was born. Before heading to the park, we have to say hello.

Noumena has to stay on my lap for a little while before she feels comfortable venturing off and playing with Jeremiah. In short order, however, Noumena is up and talking, grabbing balls that were laying in the yard and playing with it with Jeremiah.

* Park

When we arrive at the park, there's a woman their with her 4 year old daughter and her 18 year old son. Noumena is initially scared of the strangers and the little girl asks why Noumena is afraid. I tell her that she's a stranger and then she says, "I can't be a stranger I'm just a little kid." It was so cute. In a very short time Noumena has acclimated and wants to play.

She climbs the platforms with the other little girl and goes down the slide once. Soon, they are about to leave, but the mother tells the little girl that she can ride around the sidewalk on her scooter a little while longer. As they walk to the little girls scooter, I prompt Noumena to follow them by following them myself. Of course Noumena begins to run after me. She falls trying to take a short cut off the sidewalk. I knew she didn't hurt herself, but she wanted Daddy to come pick her up anyway. I pick her up and by that time, the little girl is on her scooter. Seeing as Noumena's in my arms, we start chasing her. The little girl laughs and veers off the side walk. She's not very good at being chased, so I scream "Run Noumena! She's after us now!" The little girl is much better chasing us. We switch back and forth from chasee to chaser for a little while before I decide it's time to go.

Just before we go, Noumena sees the mom sit down on the swing next to her 18 year old sun who's on the other swing and decides she wants to swing as well. I can't resist, so I put her in the swing and we swing for a little while before saying goodbye and heading home.

* Bath Time

It's 8:20pm when we get back and Noumena and I are playing in the living room until it's time for bath. We actually played a little too long and didn't end up getting into the bath until it was 8:36pm, 6 minutes later than usual. She's back to her regular self and doesn't whine at all more than usual in the tub. It's good because now I feel like I can clean her thoroughly without causing too much distress. I shampoo her, and wash her body before getting her out and getting ready for bed.

* Bed Time

It's later than usual by the time we get her dressed and her teeth brushed: 8:56pm. So, instead of feeding the pets with her, I just take her straight to the bedroom. She collapse almost instantly when /Isn't She Lovely/ comes on. I will never get tired of how amazing Noumena is at bed time. She's so accustomed to going to bed at the same hour that it's so easy to put her down. We dance for 10 minutes before I lay her in her crib for bed.

Noumena I'm so happy you feel better and I'm so excited to spend the weekend with you! We're going to the beach on Sunday! I hope you're excited too.

Good night, sweet dreams, love of my life!!!

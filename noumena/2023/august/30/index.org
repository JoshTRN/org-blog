* Morning

This morning, I didn't even get out of bed until well after Noumena's mother arrived and woke Noumena up pulling her from her crib and changing her diaper. They were playing, Noumena in her cute owl pajamas, when I got to the living room. I fed Noumena her breakfast and then went straight to work.

* Hanging Out With Mommy At Home

Noumena and her mother had so much fun today! A few times when I came out they were doing different activities. When I first came out, they had made a fort with blankets and chairs!

It was pretty windy and I wanted Noumena to get a feeling of strong winds, so I took her outside for a little while just to see what it was like.

When I came out just before I finished working, Noumena was blowing kisses! I was so excited I wanted to get it on video. Unfortunately, she stopped right when I started filming.

* Park

When I got off work and Mom was leaving, I wanted to go to the park right away since it wasn't raining and I didn't know what the weather would be like later. Mom offered to drop us off at the park saying that Noumena could ride in the front seat on my lap. I was initially nervous, but I told mom to go really slowly through the side streets until we got there. Noumena loved it.

We swung first and played on the platforms for a little before 2 kids showed up. Brently, 10 and his sister Dixie, 11. Brently absolutely loved Noumena and he kept trying to get close to her even though she was nervous around him. As time went on, Noumena got more and more comfortable and was eventually letting Brently hold her. They went on the swings and played with the debris that hand been blown to the ground by the hurricane.

Kids are so cute. Strangely enough, the wind blew hard enough to move the grill at the park. I pointed it out to Brently and Dixie. There was a metal stump sticking out of the ground close by and they surmised that it was also a grill that had been broken. I told them that it wasn't that a trash can used to sit on it and I'm not sure how it broke. I'm so confident Dixie lied to me when she said this, but she said she was there when the trash can had broken off the post. I have no idea why she would lie about it, but it was super cute anyway.

They say they're about to go on there way, so we say our goodbyes and head home too. Noumena never says goodbye close enough for anyone other than me to hear though. It's so funny... Like it takes a little while for her to realize that we're leaving. She says bye out of ear shot of all the people she's saying bye to. At least they see her hand waving.

* Nap

When we get home, I'm thinking Noumena needs a nap. When I walk her into her room, a cradle her in my arms. I can tell she's going to go to sleep, but you can tell she doesn't want to be cradled. When I lay her down in her crib, she doesn't fuss at all. She's gotten to a point where she understands nap time now. She's comfortable in her crib. When I exit the room and close her door, I hear her talking. I have no idea what she's talking about, but she talks for maybe 5 minutes before going to sleep.

* Dinner

I think Noumena's mother had given her a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch as well. But I just didn't have the energy to cook tonight, so I did also. She seemed to have difficulty eating it though... She ate maybe half a sandwich. I decided to prep some green beans from a can too, but the brand that I had wasn't very good. I took one out and ate it and decided I didn't want any. I thought I'd give Noumena one to see how she felt....

Noumena ate the whole can. I'm not exaggerating.

I wanted to give her soy milk and she wanted to do it herself. The first time I let her, she did so successfully and then looked at me with the hugest smile on her face. You could tell she was proud for drinking out of the big girl cup! I was so proud of her too.

* Neighbors House

At around 7:30pm I decided to head outside. I didn't know if I was going to head to the park or on just a walk. I just knew I wanted out of the house. I saw my neighbor's step daughter's car which meant it was likely that Jeremiah was there and also Miss Theresa's car so we went over to say hi.

They invited us inside. Noumena remembered that house from when Miss Theresa used to babysit her while I worked. She didn't want me to let her go. She thought I was going to leave her there! So she stayed close to Daddy. Jeremiah had a gas though when he came close to Noumena and then Noumena would cling to me. I'd say, "I'll protect you from Jeremiah, Noumena!" and he would just start cracking up. Eventually, he went to have his diaper change and I still wanted to go for a walk, so we said goodbye to Miss Theresa and went on our way.

* Park Again

It was 8pm and I thought if we're walking, why not jut let Noumena hang out at the park so that's where we went. Unfortunately, since it was close to bath time, we only got to stay for 5 minutes before heading back home. She played with the fallen trees the whole time we were there.

* Bath Time

We got home at 8:25pm and had a little time to kill before bath time.

Noumena stood in the bath practically the whole time. I'm not sure why she wanted to do that. So I decided since she wouldn't sit down that instead of shampooing first, I'd wash her body first. I'm not sure how I swung it, but eventually I got her to sit in the tub. I shampooed her without issue. I think with understanding nap time, the next thing that's going to come is understanding getting her hair rinsed and shampooed. She seemed so close today and made it so easy. I didn't have to distract her with toys or anything. She just let me rinse her down!

After bath, I got her dressed in her pajamas and we brushed her teeth. I learned that she can no longer be looking at the mirror or she won't brush her teeth, so I apply toothpaste to the brush, exit the bathroom, clean her teeth, and repeat the process until she's done.

* Bed Time

There's no time to feed the pets as it's already 8:55pm. We head into her room, turn off the lights and as usual she collapses to my chest. This time, she's not sleeping right away though. Instead, as /Isn't She Lovely/ plays, Noumena is singing along with both Daddy and Stevie Wonder. She isn't quiet until the end of /Stand By Me/. I sing that to her as well. When I laid her down, she was still awake, but she understood it was bed time. She didn't cry at all when I shut the door to her room and she sleeps soundly as I write.

Noumena, every day you amaze me! Today with your maturity both around bed and nap time, your progress to drinking from a big girl cup all by yourself, your sociability with other children, and even the way you handled yourself in the tub. When you were pulling my by my index finger in the park this evening, I remember thinking there really is nothing more perfect in my life than you loving me. There is no greater purpose in life for me than you, Noumena. I will strive to do whatever I can to ensure you always understand that there is nothing that will ever stop me from loving you!

Good night, sweet baby girl. I miss you as I write this and the tears well in my eyes because I love you so much. I hope you have the best sleep of your life tonight and each of the following nights.

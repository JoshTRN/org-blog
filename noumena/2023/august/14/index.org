* Morning

I don't know if I'm supposed to feel as lucky as I do, but I feel extremely lucky to have Noumena sleep as well as she does. It may just be that when toddlers reach the 15-16 month age they start to sleep really well, but man is it a big change and very appreciated since infancy. Noumena doesn't wake up until after 8am when I wake up.

We have our porridge for the day, but I had run out of soy milk, so Noumena had to have it dry. She ate all of it, though and even seemed to prefer feeding herself rather than Daddy feeding her. I may try just allowing her to feed herself in the mornings though the reason I don't do that generally is because I don't want her hair to get sticky if she touches it with the porridge and it seems faster for me to feed her than for her to do it herself.

I have to use the restroom before we head out and Noumena chases me in there grabbing the bottle she has of bath time finger paints. I toss it once to get her out of the bathroom and instead, she goes and picks it up and brings it back to me. Naturally, I do it again and once again, she brings it back.

* Dinner

Noumena wasn't whiny at all on the car ride home and the daycare worker when I came to pick her up said that she had a wonderful time today, so that made me happy. I didn't plan on giving her dinner immediately, but it seems she's come to expect it. Right when we arrive at home, Noumena is pointing towards the kitchen and doesn't want me to let her down. I start microwaving our soup for dinner, but then I also go to butter bread. I can't do it while I'm handling her, so I set her down on the stove top to butter the bread. Hilarity ensues.

[[file:putting-lid-on-face.jpg]]

Noumena and I share the soup and bread but when we get to the bottom she points at it as though she wants more. Since there isn't any more, I decide I'll just let her drink the broth. It's like I discovered her hidden obsession. She absolutely loves the broth to the point where /she starts inhaling it into her nose/!

* Hanging out

I change Noumena's diaper shortly after dinner and the get a call from Oksana just as I'm finishing up and set Noumena down on the floor. She says that she got a surprise for Noumena and I already knew what it was before she told me. Everyone knows Noumena loves owls so much that Oksana just naturally decided to get her a stuffed owl toy. I turn on the video on my phone so Oksana can see Noumena receive her gift.

While Noumena plays, I spend a little bit of time cleaning up after dinner. We hang out in the house for about an hour, but I wanted to get some frames to hang Noumena's art work up, so I decide to go to Walmart. I just know the daycare is going to be asking for diapers soon so I decide we're going to need those as well.

* Walmart

Noumena makes it so long without falling asleep in the car. She falls asleep right before we get to Walmart which makes it all the worse. I hate waking her when she's just fallen asleep.

[[file:sleeping-in-car.jpg]]

Noumena also needs bigger shoes so after picking up the diapers we head to the shoes section. I can't find any of the properly fitting shoes, she's a size 3 now, but they don't have any good ones in that size. She does like throwing the shoes I hand her out of the cart, though. I can't tell what's so funny about it, but apparently it is.

We make our way to the frame section which is also where the mirrors are. I can't find any frames that I like. They all seem too bulky for my purposes so I think I'll have to get them online. She wants out of the cart at this point, so I set her down and she heads right for the mirrors to look at herself and me in them.

We then migrate to the toys section since it's nearby. I park the cart and let Noumena have a field day.

All we ended up getting was diapers which was not at all the purpose for going there. That's okay, I don't see it as a wasted trip. Noumena had tons of fun. I let her ride in the shopping cart all the way to the car. All the people see her and smile, she's just that cute. I can't see her face, but I can only imagine she's smiling back.

* Park

On the way home I look at the time and realize I can get to the park at about 7:55pm and having traveled there in the car, that means that we'll have 20 minutes to play at the park before we need to head back home.

I thought Noumena would try to climb these bars at the park and I'm always encouraging mild risk taking, so I'm prepared to help her do it, but it turns out she just wants to throw trash away instead.

At some point this puppy comes running up to us. I reached my hand out to see if he was nice and he seemed really nice so I let him close to Noumena. She has the appropriate reaction to an animal she doesn't know right away and acts scared. I reassure her, but I'm proud she has the discernment to recognize that she shouldn't be comfortable with unknown animals approaching her.

The dog follows us to the car and I think I'm going to have to take him home and then take him to a shelter, but when I strap Noumena into the car seat as we're about to leave, he runs away heading back to presumably wherever he came from.

* Bath And Bed Time

Arriving home, I carry the diapers and Noumena in the house. Kisa already wants in. She must be hungry. She follows us onto the porch and when she does, I let Noumena down to pet her while I unlock the door. Kisa runs in the house, followed by me and then Noumena starts to follow us in and then backs out. I guess she decides she wants to stay outside. I go back and grab her taking her into the house.


We have about 10 minutes before bath time and I take this ten minutes to start reading Noumena a book, but once she grows tired of that, I just relax for a little while before I have to get her ready for her bath.

At 8:30pm I start running the water and go and get Noumena's clean pajamas out from the dryer as well as the quilt I lay on her changing table. I get her naked and take her to the bath but I had forgotten to turn the faucet down to a cooler temperature, so she sits on my lap while I run the cold water to compensate for the hot water. I try making quick work of getting her clean and play with her with her submarine after doing so. After bathing, I get her into her pajamas and brush her teeth. The pets already had food so we head straight to bed.

I thought it might be a good idea to let her sleep with her owl she loves so much, so I set that in her crib. This turns out to be a mistake. I won't make it again.

We dance to /Isn't She Lovely/ and Noumena false asleep against my chest. I tilt her down into a cradle position when /Stand By Me/ comes on, and give her several kisses. We get through the first verse of /Just The Two Of Us/ and I think she's totally out. But, when I lay her down, she starts crying. She usually stops crying very soon because she's so sleepy and I thought tonight would be no exception. I head to the kitchen to finish the dishes. But she ends up crying longer than 5 minutes, so I go in to check on her. Strangely enough, right as I enter, she's fallen asleep, but the owl is playing music. I lifted the owl thinking that was what probably kept her awake. I'm not sure she's ready to sleep with it yet.


Noumena, I loved spending time with you today. I can't wait to see what tomorrow has in store for us. I miss you all day at work and even now as you sleep I stand here writing about you missing you. Good night, sweet baby. You're always loved.

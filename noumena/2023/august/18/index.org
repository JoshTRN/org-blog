* Morning

I inadvertently slept until 8:05am this morning. Noumena still hadn't awakened as far as I could tell, so I brushed my teeth, prepared our porridge breakfast, and poured myself a cup of coffee. Thinking I would be waking Noumena up, I quietly turned the handle on the door to her room and slowly pushed it open while entering the room. As I drew closer to her crib, I noticed she was lying down, yet her eyes were open. She was softly tracing her blanket with a lone finger, seemingly lost in her own contemplative world. Noticing me, she rolled over and began to stand her arms outstretched signaling to lift her from her crib. We eat our breakfast, get dressed and there's no time to waste before heading to daycare so we take off.

* Picking up Noumena

At some point when Noumena started gaining a lot of independence, when I would pick her up from daycare, she would run away. My guess was that she was trying initiate a game of chase or show me around her class at daycare. Nevertheless, the fact that she didn't run straight for me elicited a subtle pang of sadness because however untrue it felt as though she didn't miss me. These last few days have been quite different, though. The moment she notices me, she gets up and runs to me often leaving her favorite blanket behind because she's so excited to see me. I'm extremely excited to see her as well! I scoop her up and we head out to the car.

Knowing how much Noumena hates the car seat, I try to make a game out of playing on my car. I set her on the trunk to jump off and then on the roof prompting the same behavior. She jumps of the trunk, but gets leery when faced with jumping off the roof ultimately sitting down. Soon after, I strap her into her car seat and we head home.

Upon arrival, I haven't decided what we're going to do about dinner, so instead, we play in the living room until I can decide. Noumena wastes no time picking out her owl books and bringing them to me to read to her.

* Dinner

I had initially thought I would make macaroni and cheese for Noumena, but I have been trying to watch the amount of fat I consume, so opted for pasta instead. I try a few things to distract her because I don't like her in the kitchen with me when I cook, but each attempt fails.

First, I lead Chalmers into her room, anticipating that she'll follow. Once inside, I arrange her toys across the floor in the hopes that she'll engage with them. Regrettably, when I close her door, her reaction turns to tears. I wait for a minute to see if her distress will subside, but her tears persist, compelling me to provide comfort. I lift her up, gently wipe away her tears, and settle back into the living room with her.

My next attempt is to turn on the T.V. When I sit in front of it with her, she's content watching it. However when I go to the kitchen to resume cooking, her tears also resume. I gather that she has separation anxiety, prompting her to follow me into the kitchen.

Ultimately, I give up trying to distract her, set her in her high-chair, wheel it into the kitchen, and hand her measuring cups to use as toys so she can help me cook.

* Park

Because I had waited to cook dinner, we head to the park later than our usual time. It's about 7pm when we head out. Traveling the same path we traversed yesterday seeing the dogs and the chickens, we encounter them both again, and obviously Noumena loves it.

We play for about an hour and begin heading home a little after 8pm. On the way back, a massive span of flapping wings catches my eye overhead. To my astonishment, it's an owl---Noumena's favorite animal! It flew as close to us as you'd naturally expect an owl to get! I film the owl closeup and Noumena's reaction to it.

* Home

Arriving at home, Noumena's reading takes precedence over all else. She brings me her owl books, hands them to me and without saying anything is obviously demanding I read them to her. We get through her /Where Is The Owl?/ book as well as her national geographic owl books before heading to bath time.

* Bath/Bed Time

I have a special moment of eye contact with Noumena in the bath when I lather the shampoo on her head. She seems averse to rinsing off, however so I have to resort to my previous stroke of ingenuity to distract her. As she sits in the water, one of her foam letters floats by. I put it in my mouth and hang onto it while she tries to pull it out in a mini game of tug o war. This distracts her enough to rinse her shampoo out. Once her bath is complete, we move to the dryer, where I had already cleaned Noumena's pajamas but forgotten to fold them. I dress her in the freshly cleaned pajamas, assist her in brushing her teeth, and then we spend a few moments gazing into the mirror together. Her fascination with her own reflection is palpable. I can't discern whether she recognizes herself in the mirror, but her captivation by the image is undeniable leaving me with the largest smile stretching across my face.

Noumena seems to have become habituated to bed time. The moment we're in her room with the lights out to follow our routine, her head collapses onto my shoulder.

Although you can't tell, her eyes are still open in the photo above. Regardless of how quickly she's going to fall asleep, I turn on our playlist and dance through to /Just The Two Of Us/ together before laying her into her crib. She's so exhausted that she barely flinches when I lay her down only moving slightly to get comfortable before drifting off into dream land.


Good night, my precious baby. I hope you sleep and dream well and I'm excited for us to spend the weekend together!

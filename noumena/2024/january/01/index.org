Humanity has a very peculiar quirk. As time moves on and we settle into routines, a lot of the magic in every moment is lost. That's often   why novelty is such a thrill. New experiences---new emotions. Some of us get addicted to it and make all sorts of decisions---good or bad--because of it.

I remember when Noumena was born and I first held her in my arms. Until I was a father, I never wanted to be one. The moment I held her in my arms, my whole world, everything I thought I knew about myself collapsed around me and I let out a yelp unable to contain the tidal wave of emotion. She was the most beautiful thing I'd ever laid eyes on. A beautiful new born, only 7 pounds, was enough to take a 32 year old man and crumple him into dust effortlessly.

But as the days go by, these moments fade from presentness to mind. It may just as well be---if I was overcome at all times the way I was when Noumena was born, nothing would get done! Still, they oughtn't go unappreciated. Part of it what made me cry out in the delivery room was the fact that it was new. Until then, I'd never felt a love so pure, unadulterated and intense. I'd never before felt that I wanted to give my soul to this little human and do everything in my power to protect and guide her through life.

That love hasn't left in any way. It burns like a raging fire deep within my soul each and every passing day. But often I realize that I've grown accustomed to the flames. That same love doesn't cause outbursts of tears at every moment since. It feels like I'm taking it for granted. Maybe sometimes I am. But it doesn't have to be so.

Imagine if at every difficulty one were to have while raising their child, those memories crashed to mind with the same tidal force as the first experience. How much more understanding, empathetic and compassionate would they be? How could they maintain their frustration or anger or whatever litany of emotions come with the rearing of offspring? I don't know the answers to these questions, but what I do know is that the child that's causing all that grief and maybe heartache is the same child that clawed its way into their very soul the day they'd met. Even amidst the turmoil, we have our kids and they have us and the very experience we're having is new. Never been had before in exactly the same way.

We forget that this profoundly intimate moment we're having will be lost to the sands of time as with every other new experience. Our minds play tricks on us and we don't realize we're capable of having the same appreciation for our wonderful child that we had when our eyes met theirs for the very first time. After all, despite the monotony of daily life and amidst the struggles, the love never goes away and never dissipates. We are tricked by circumstance into not recognizing it in these moments but it's always there. We go through life with a burning flame deep in us that we're so used to, we don't notice in the same way we noticed when it was ignited. Sometimes we catch glimpses of it, but, in every moment, it's always there and always just as warm.

In every moment... It's always there and it's /always/ just as warm.

* Good Morning And Happy New Year, Noumena!

[[file:laying-on-chalmers-3.jpg]]

Again, my alarm wakes me at 8:30am which I promptly turn off and fall back asleep. In fact, it's 9:15am when I finally drag myself from bed having stayed up far too late last night. Thankfully, Noumena has yet to awaken, but I think the commotion of me preparing breakfast arouses her from sleep. I don't know if she had bad dreams or what, but this morning she was groaning. It's not her typical awakening where she simply talks to herself and rolls around in bed. She's clearly just a little more distressed than usual. What a way to begin the new year. Who knows, maybe it was from all the fireworks last night.

When I go to Noumena's room, it's made no better by the fact that she's soiled her diaper and so I have to change it immediately. Clearly unhappy with the situation, she lets out a flurry of cries as if she's in pain. I hate having to change her diaper like this. Normally, she's so much more accommodating. I do my best job to clean her quickly as well as still being thorough, but she's still distraught even after we've finished which is also unusual. She cries all the way to the breakfast table. I thought maybe she was just really hungry, but I can't get her to eat. Noumena gestures towards the kitchen, so I walk in there with her. She points to her cup, so I fill it with water and she takes a quick drink before her cries resume and once again she's dissatisfied. I hold her tightly kissing her and telling her I understand as we walk through the living room hoping I can comfort her.

Nothing works except as we approach the TV she points to it. I turn it on immediately and we start watching music together finally calming her down. I sit with her and watch until she's acclimated and is finally ready to start moving around. Once she's climbed down from the couch, and starts investigating, I know she feels better and is ready to eat. Thankfully, my lovely little girl has resumed her typical demeanor and we can finally have breakfast together.

I can't remember why I turned the TV back on after breakfast, but we kept watching music videos throughout the morning

Eventually, Noumena's attention drifts towards her books and we read /I'm Scared/ maybe five times before she goes to her book shelf and gets /Goodnight Little Noumena/---the book Oksana had gotten her for Christmas---which we read about three times and then we read /Go Dog. Go/ once. I've gotten her playing independently (removing her clothes from her drawers for better or worse) so I take the opportunity to clean up after breakfast. As the day moves on, I want to get out of the house, so we head to Tidewater Acres Park after getting her dressed.

* Tidewater Acres Park

Taking a bit of a different route than usual, for the majority of it Noumena wants to be held. I always encourage her to walk whenever I get the chance for a couple reasons. Firstly, I want her to feel free and independent. Secondly, the more she walks the easier it will be to put her down for nap time. But, since she wants to be held today, I'm not complaining. I relish every opportunity I get to have my daughter in my arms.

She knows the park and she knows we're there to play, so the moment we pass through the gates, she wants to be let down. The same as yesterday, she heads straight for the swings. So I put her in and make a game out of chasing her as she swings away, gnawing at her limbs, kissing her and giving her big pushes. Once she tires of one swing, she demands to be let down so she can move onto the next. All in all, we swing at every swing in the park.

While swinging, a mother and her daughter Zari, 5, arrive at the park. Noumena, of course, wants to play, but wary of strangers, she stands back to observe from afar until she's eventually comfortable and joins Zari on the playground equipment. We make a game out of chasing after Zari, sliding, and just playing all over the playground.

It's already later than usual by the time we leave. I want to make Thai green curry for dinner and planned to do it while Noumena naps, but I remembered I'd forgotten snow peas when I bought the ingredients yesterday, so I walk with Noumena almost all the way to Harvey's, the grocery store down the street, before realizing that'd I'd forgotten my wallet at home. So I head back home, but obviously I don't want to put my tired baby through walking all the way back whether I'm carrying her or not, plus it's nearing her nap time, so I pack her into the car once we get home and we drive back to Harvey's. We buy the snow peas and I set Noumena on the conveyor belt and the cashier happily turns it on inching Noumena toward her and I joke a sign said I get a free toddler that's supposed to come free with one package of snow peas. As we're leaving, a woman asks for a ride home. Wanting to be kind, I weigh the risks in my mind before ultimately agreeing to give her a ride.

Once we arrive home, Noumena is exhausted. I stripped her down because she was wearing white and I was going to feed her vegetable soup for lunch so I didn't want to stain her clothes. She refuses to eat though. She's far to tired for that, so I take her to the bedroom, change her diaper, and lay her in bed wearing only a diaper. She's out after less than a minute. She was exhausted by all the activity today.

* Mommy Stops By for Dinner

Mommy texted me and told me she was going to come over after she went to the gym nearby, so I asked her to bring rice home (another ingredient I'd forgotten to purchase when I went to the store) so she agrees. Noumena awakens just minutes before Mommy arrives. Mommy made Jell-O as I cook the rice for our curry and once our curry is done, she eats at Noumena's table with her.

Mommy's busy today, so she doesn't stay long. Noumena came back for another helping of rice and as she's eating, Mommy leans in to kiss Noumena good-bye and takes her leave.

* Hanging Out At Home

[[file:laying-with-daddy-in-tent.jpg]]

I change Noumena's diaper again and get her dressed after dinner. She ate in only a diaper because I still didn't want her to get her white clothes stained. Once I change her, I set her down in her room and play with her there for a while before again deciding to go for a walk.

* Nighttime Walk

We leave the house at about 6:30pm and walk around the neighborhood looking at the Christmas lights that are still up. I decide to go back to the park with her even though it's dark because again I want her to wear out all her energy. Once again we play musical chairs at all the swings eventually finding our way to the gate where she opens and shuts it repeatedly as a game. Toddlers always find interest in the most mundane things.

When I want to leave the park, Noumena protests, but she's easily distracted by me simply pointing out and naming things on our walk and having her repeat after me.

* Before Bath Time

Once home, we read /Goodnight Little Noumena/ several times, but we spend most of our time playing with her flash cards after a quick detour to the bedroom where she loves on Kisa.

* Bath & Bed Time

We follow our typical bath time routine and I get her cleaned fairly hastily leaving us longer to put her to bed. After her bath, I get Noumena dressed, brush her hair and teeth and bring her into the room for sleep. With the lights still on, I set her in her crib which is unusual, but I had to fold her blanket in a way so as to act as a pillow for her which is usually already done. Once it's folded, I lay her on it on her back and drape another blanket over her for bed. In a way it feels like the first time I'm "tucking her in" because she's still looking at me while I'm doing it. I'm greeted with the most amazing smile as I pull the blanket over her body. I turn off the lights assuring her that I'm not going anywhere, turn on our bed time playlist and hold her hand as she falls asleep singing to her as she drifts off.

I'm reminded of how it first felt to dance with her while putting her to sleep and listening to the lyrics of /Just The Two Of Us/ I begin to cry tears of joy while holding the hand of my already fast asleep toddler.

I love you Noumena. Sweet dreams!

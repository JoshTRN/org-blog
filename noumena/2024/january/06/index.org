* Good Morning, Noumena!

I'm not sure if I've been blessed or cursed. Last night, Noumena woke up while I was in the middle of writing the journal entry. As usual, I don't think it's a big deal, so I go in there to calm her down. I think after at most 15 minutes she'll be back asleep. Honestly, the first time I went in there, she did fall back asleep after 10 minutes allowing me to get a bit more writing done. However, 15 minutes later, I hear the groans slowly intensifying once again. Again, I think, not a big deal. I'll just calm her down again. Boy, was I wrong! Noumena had some kind of insomnia last night. I laid beside her crib and held her hand while she tried to go to sleep but for her the sleep just would not come. She wasn't bouncing around or trying not to sleep. For the most part she would lay there silently, but every so often, she'd get uncomfortable and move and even while holding her hand she would sit up and begin fussing again. I even had to steal one of her 4 blankets and drape it over myself because I was laying on the cold floor shirtless. Ultimately, I was in there for about 2 hours. I finally got out of her room at about 1:40am. At 2am, the groans once again began to reach my ears.... However, they were ever so slight and completely dissipated in after 2 minutes where she slept through the night.

If she had woken up at her usual time, I'd have been an absolute wreck! She must have needed the sleep despite having awoken in the night, however, because I didn't get out of bed until 9:30am and when I went in to check on her she was still sleeping. I didn't disturb her and simply left her warm porridge on the table waiting for her, of course with cinnamon sprinkled on top as is becoming our new tradition. While she sleeps I take this time to finish folding the laundry I'd left in the dryer from last night since I obviously couldn't fold it since I was in her room so late. I go in at about 10am to arouse her from sleep. She's still sleeping when I enter and a every so slightly cranky that I'm waking her up, but after playing with her blankets with her for a short time, she's happy and ready to go. I have to change her diaper, so I do and without dressing her in any bottoms, I take her to her table so we can enjoy our breakfast together.

It's quickly approaching time for us to go to the library for story time, so I ask Noumena to choose between her white dress outfit and her blue outfit. She chooses her white one and I get her dressed in my bedroom since that's where a good portion of her laundry is. The rest is scattered about her floor as she insists on withdrawing it from her drawers and throwing it about whenever it's neatly folded and organized. It's warm enough outside that I simply bring her jacket with us without putting it on her in case it gets cold and we walk to the car to drive to story time.

* Story Time

We arrive just minutes before story time. When I withdraw Noumena from the car, I attempt to get her to walk with me. I'm not sure if it's laziness or just wanting to be close to Daddy---I choose to believe the former---but whenever we're just walking somewhere, Noumena has begun to insist on being held and me carrying her. So I carry her until we reach the library only setting her down so she can climb the stairs in the atrium which she's rather fond of doing.

Entering story time, we're the first ones there. A few others trickle in, but just as it begins, Noumena gets up and rushes out. I always have the mind set that this is her time, so I never want to constrain her where she doesn't want to be. She runs to the bookshelf where it's easy for her to access the books and picks them out one by one for us to read together. We never get through so much as 2 pages before she decides she'd like a different book, so she takes the book we're currently reading back and grabs another. After having gone through a dozen or so books, eventually, we do make it back to the story time room where they're singing the final song and a little girl maybe 2 years older than Noumena named Kione is there. We've known her for a while. She's playing with the mats and Noumena plays along. We close out story time with a song from Misses Owl, the animatronic owl that sings at the end of story time and we head to the play room.

Our play is cut short of where I would have cut it off normally because I get a whiff of a stinky diaper. I ask Noumena if she's pooed and she reaches down to her diaper signifying that she had which gets a chuckle out of the other parents in the playroom. I take her to the car to get changed and deciding I want Thai food again, we head to lunch.

* Lunch

I know right away what I want when we get there, so right as we get seated I order the fried veggie spring rolls, fried tofu and Thai green curry to share with Noumena. While we wait for our food to come, Noumena, curious by the art in the restaurant, begins to point to it, so I take her up to all of it to observe.

Our food comes and we enjoy our lunch together. Noumena has gotten a lot better at not making a mess while eating which makes me proud of her. The little mess she does make, she also helps me clean up after her and wipes down the table with a wet napkin.

* Wal-Mart

Since the Thai food place is so close to Wal-Mart and I remember that I have to get dog and cat food as well as diapers, we head there after lunch. Once again, I set her down on the ground right after pulling her from her car seat, but of course she just wants Daddy to carry her, so I carry her all the way into the store where I set her in the shopping cart. She's so well behaved the entire time. Once we get to the pet aisles, I hand her a squeaky hedgehog and squeeze it a few times for her while we pick up the food. Attempting to capitalize on the trip to Wal-Mart I try to stock up on soy milk but it's literally all gone. There's not a single half gallon of soymilk in the whole place. Oh well, I'll get it later.

We head to the self checkout where I pick up the scan gun and let Noumena scan the items with a little assistance from daddy pulling the trigger. The receipt is printed and I tell her to hang onto it because we're going to have to show it to the employee that stands by the doorway on our way out. Noumena hands the receipt to the employee, says "hi" and we're ready to head out.

* Jacksonville Arboretum

The arboretum is so close by, I'm compelled to take Noumena there. I carry her into the arboretum and let her walk once we're there. She stops at one of the fenced off areas and I keep walking forcing her to chase after me. She chooses to go down of the trails herself, so I follow her telling her she's absolutely free to go wherever she wants as long as she stays on the trails.

We traversed all over the arboretum. Close to the pond that's there, there's a gazebo held up by pillars which have enough space to stand on. I ask Noumena if she can jump from one pillar to the next, so she attempts it. Of course, she's too little to do it on her own, so taking her by the hand I assist her in jumping from pillar to pillar. We make it to every single one that supports the gazebo.

[[file:sitting-on-tree-stump.jpg]]

I take special care to take Noumena to all of the various boardwalks as she loves them so much.

It's getting late, a little past 2pm, and I know Noumena needs to take a nap, so I carry her back to the car. She begins to fall asleep on the drive back, but I know that if she only gets a brief nap, she's often full of energy after only 15 minutes, so I keep her up on the ride home only stopping to refuel where I jump around outside the vehicle as the tank fills to entertain her---blowing on the window expanding my cheeks and opening the door to kiss her and banging on the sides of the car.

* Nap Time

[[file:sleeping-soundly.jpg]]

Noumena is exhausted by the time we get back. I change her diaper, put her down, tuck her in and within the span of 2 minutes she's already fast asleep. I gaze at her beauty briefly appreciating it before going to lay down myself.

* Mommy Arrives!

Mere moments after Noumena awakens from her nap, Mommy arrives after getting off work. Mommy after reading Noumena a few books of Noumena's choosing, plays with her flash cards and I show Mommy a lot of the words Noumena can say just from looking at the cards. Mommy's really hungry from work and wants to go to Denny's since there Noumena eats free on Saturday's, so I change Noumena's diaper, get her dressed in her bottoms and shoes and we head to the car.

* Dinner

Right as we enter Denny's there is a claw machine juxtaposed against the wall next to the front door. I can't resist, so Mommy holds Noumena as Daddy tries to win her a stuffed animal. Unfortunately, luck was not on my side and no stuffed animal was forthcoming. Denny's is very short staffed, so we signal to the waiter that we're there, pick up our own menus and find ourselves a seat. Noumena stands at the booth playing with the accoutrements at the table with Mommy. While waiting for food, Noumena appears parched and drinks a lot of water. Getting a little antsy, I take her outside to wander through the grass and around the building where she's talking a lot but I understand none of it.

We're served shortly after returning to the restaurant. Noumena has pancakes, toast and eggs, but is mostly focused on sharing Mommy's chicken that rests atop her salad. This chicken ends up being the bulk of Noumena's meal. That and the pancakes because what kind of self respecting kid doesn't love pancakes. Mommy expresses concern about having an unhealthy meal, but I reassure her that as long as it's not habitual, it's just Noumena enjoying a bit of the spice of life.

After dinner, we head home listening to music along the way.

* Spending Time With Mommy

I still needed to go to the store near my house to get stuff for Noumena's porridge in the morning, so Noumena hung out with Mommy until I returned. Mommy spends time with Noumena giving me time to cook the porridge to have it ready for her in the morning. Noumena comes by to help a few times but then goes right back to spending time with Mommy.

Mommy had her listening to music that I can't stand, so I take the remote and we listen to some of Noumena's favorite songs which I also like and I dance with her in the living room a bit.

Mommy leaves shortly thereafter and even though it's getting rather late, I decide that I'd like to take Noumena on a walk despite the time.

* Nighttime Walk

It's 8pm and I figured that since it was warm all day we didn't need coats. Noumena, as usual, walks down the drive way, but once again when we get to the street she demands I carry her. I hold her all the way to the Church parking lot where we run through the grass, she jumps off the bench into Daddy's arms a few times, chases my shadow and say's "bye" to various inanimate objects, walks away from them only to return moments later in order to say "bye" again and repeat the whole process.

As I said, it was already late, when we left, so after only about 20 minutes, we head back home and she stays on my shoulders the entire way shaking my head around in the process.

* Bath & Bed Time

We arrive and immediately it's bath time. I take Noumena to commence our nightly routine. She draws the bath water turning the faucet on herself and I take her to the bedroom to strip down and throw her clothes in the laundry basket before throwing away her diaper in the trash. Kisa is resting on the bed, so it takes a little longer get undressed because Noumena keeps throwing her clothes on top of Kisa. Kisa, being such a good girl, takes it in stride. Eventually I get Noumena stripped and in the tub.

I wash her really quickly since I've been trying to get her to go to bed a few minutes earlier as it's been taking longer to get Noumena to sleep. Again tonight, she pushes all her bath toys to one side of the tub and again to the opposite side repeating this a few times.


After her bath, I let her choose between her Mickey Mouse pajamas and her starry pajamas and she chooses the starry ones. I get our bed time playlist ready, tuck her in and lay with her for the duration of the playlist while she falls asleep her hand in mine.

Good night, sweet Noumena! I'm so happy we get to spend all day together tomorrow! I wonder what we'll get up to!

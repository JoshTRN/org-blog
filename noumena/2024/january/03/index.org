* Good Morning, Noumena!

I don't get out of bed until 9am and Noumena is content as ever in her crib. I warm her porridge and head to her bedroom to awaken her. She's awake in her crib and I give her a few moments to acclimate, but even asking her if she wants to eat doesn't motivate her to insist on being let out of her crib. Time is of the essence as I don't want to be late to work, so I scoop her up and take her to the dining room to eat only stopping to say good morning to the owls painted on the canvases adorning her walls.

After eating, I'm in a hurry to get Noumena dressed, so I let her choose between her blue and white outfits, dress her and we head to the car.

Dropping her off, she clearly doesn't want me to go and begins to whine. The other kids are settling in for drawing time, so I sit her at a chair and she seems to be content once they begin their activity, but when she notices me leaving, she begins to cry again. As much as this seems like a slight regression, it still makes me feel loved by her, so a part of me is happy that she doesn't want me to go.

* Daycare pickup

When I picked Noumena up from daycare today she seemed to be in a stellar mood. As I approached the toddler classroom, one of the daycare workers swung open the gate reminding me that the gate is in place because toddlers are so rambunctious. None of the "rooms" consisting of four classes for the various age groups in her daycare are actual rooms surrounded by walls with a doorway, but rather logical partitions in the open floor plan demarcated by furniture arrangements---book cases, cubbies and the like, and none of the other ones have gates preventing the children from free movement. I feel a sort of relief at this realization because it's evidence that as Noumena ages, she's going to be more amenable to instruction even though currently, she's a very well behaved girl. Nevertheless, I obviously expect many more challenges as she grows  and perhaps even more challenges than conveniences of maturation---just not so much of the "don't go there" sort.

As I pass through the gate, Noumena is sitting on the floor just to the left facing away from the where I stand and seems to have just taken a tumble as the other teacher, Ms. Tweety, is reapplying her shoe which had fallen off. I crouch behind her silently ready to surprise her when she realizes I'm there. When she sees me she leaps up, a giant overtakes her face and she rushes into my arms while I smother her with kisses. She knows we're going home, so immediately says "bye" to all her classmates. I put on her jacket informing her it's cold outside and then join her in goodbyes as we exit the building.

Once we're outside and she sees the car, I ask her if she wants to walk the rest of the way. Without saying yes, she leans her body over signifying that she'd like to walk. I set her down and she begins running to the car and, her shoe catching on the concrete, she immediately takes a spill and catches herself with her hands on the concrete. A lot of times when she falls, I pause before coddling her, but I could tell this was a spill she wouldn't just get up from, so I take her into my arms without hesitation and begin to comfort her on our trip to the car. When we reach the car, her stellar mood had all but vanished. She's calm enough for me to put in her car seat, but she's rather unhappy about it. I am able to get her focused on a book though and we begin our drive home. Once she tires of the book, she voices her discontent at being strapped into her car seat, so I put on her favorite song, /Levitation 21/ by Tigran Hamasyan, and making the cutest rolling and waving hand gestures in concert with the music. My little conductor. I wish so badly that I could record her behavior in her car seat, but sadly that would stop the music from playing so I opt for her continuing her enjoyment. Jotting it down here will have to suffice.

* Arriving Home

Every "no" from a toddler has to be taken with a grain of salt as I've come to realize. That isn't to say that you shouldn't respect it as if it's true every time---moreso that every "no" warrants deeper probing for confirmation. I'm very keen on only asking Noumena questions where "no" is an acceptable answer. She understands when yes or no questions are being asked of her, so I want her to understand that whenever she says "no", I'm going to respect it. I'm imperfect, however, and sometimes  I make mistakes either by not taking her "no" seriously or asking a question where "no" is not an acceptable answer. Today's mistake was of the former.

Thinking that since Noumena's usually so excited to see Chalmers, I remove her from her car seat and ask if she wants to see Chalmers. She says "no." I think she can't be serious. I come to find out once we're inside our home that she was in fact very serious. She begins batting her hand at Chalmers even though he'd done nothing wrong. I, of course, reprimand her for trying to hit him which culminates in a fit and rolling around on the floor. I grab her by her arms in effort to bring pull her up to console her, but she throws her head back towards the floor audibly making contact with a thud. I know that had to hurt! She begins crying so I pick her up and proceed to comfort her. From the fall when I picked her up at daycare to the banging of her head against the hard floor, today is just not Noumena's day!

* Dinner

While Noumena is still unsettled from hitting her head, luckily there's comfort in sight. She gestures towards the kitchen and I proceed to take her there. The urgency with which I want to console her has me reaching for something for her to consume straight away. She likes bread, so I give her a slice of sour dough and set her down at her table. She refuses to be set down without making her discontent known, however. Noumena wants to eat bread, /and/ be held by Daddy. Fine. I do what I can literally single handedly as a baby occupies the space in above my left arm spooning the leftover vegetable soup into a large bowl so I can heat mine and her dinners simultaneously. Eventually, I do need to use both hands, however, so after the food is warmed from the microwave, I set her on the counter-top while I mixed the soup with a spoon---taking a bite to ensure it's not too hot---before transferring some of to a small bowl for her. I set her toddler table with a placemat, the spoon she chose and a glass of soymilk, Noumena in hand, and by that time she's ready to eat.

I knew that I hadn't overheated the soup and that she could eat it right away. Nevertheless, Noumena proceeds with caution. As she draws the first spoonful to her mouth, the word "hot" escapes her lips just after she'd placed a small portion in her mouth and subsequently removed it without ingesting any of it. Holding the spoon out in my direction, she says it again. "Hot." Of course, I know she wants me to blow on it. I'm not sure if she wants me to blow on it because she appreciates the affectionate gesture or if she's simply entertained by it. Either way, I'm more than happy to oblige but it's nice to think that the reason is that she wants more confirmation of her fathers love.

We sit across from each other eating and as she picks out specific vegetables from the soup, I name them and she repeats after me to the best of her ability before promptly consuming them only stopping periodically to have me blow on a spoonful that's clearly cooled far below a palatable temperature. Once she lifts her bowl from the table to try to carry it around the house, I know she's done, so I have her set it back down and I pick it up to transfer to the sink while she run into the living room to play with Chalmers.

She pulls her favorite book, /Goodnight Little Noumena/ from the bookshelf and brings it to me to read to her. After dinner, we read that book several times and a few others, play with some toys and make a mess out of the clothes in her room before I try to teach her a way that she can put on her jacket independently so we can go outside.

* Nighttime Walk

[[file:daddy-and-noumenas-shadow.jpg]]

It's drizzling as we exit the house, but I barely notice with my hoddie on, and I have to dissipate the insane toddler energy somehow, so since Noumena's wearing a jacket anyway, I decide it's not going to hurt much if we get a little wet. I set her down and she walks down the driveway herself, but once she reaches the street, she wants to be carried. Her fascination with the moon and sky causes her to look towards it while she's in my arms, but the rain is falling and she doesn't expect the droplets to hit her face, so every one causes a mild startle that's just too funny.

We walk down the street to the church only stopping briefly for Noumena to investigate a drain gate that she has to look closely at every time it catches her attention. When we arrive at the church parking lot, she insists on being let down to wander. She runs all the way through the parking lot and up to the grass just before the awning that covers the church entryway. Even though the rain is ever so slight, she's getting progressively wetter and preferring to play in the wet grass only heightens my concern. I can't take her home because she still has so much energy to burn through but we can't stay out here, so I decide to take her to the CVS just across the drainage ditch adjacent to the church to play with the toys therein.

* Playing In CVS

Again, prioritizing as much energy expenditure as possible, as we pass through the sliding doors of the CVS, I set Noumena down to walk back to the very limited toy section. Winding the aisles, Noumena reaches for the products lining the shelves, but every time I say "no touching" without hesitation she obeys and moves on. It's mere seconds before fascination crops up motivating me to tell her again not to touch, but every time she obeys. Such a good girl.

We get to the toy section and I allow her to play with whatever she wants, but she takes the most interest in the baby dolls that seem just proportionately sized to her exact height as though they could really be her babies. If her toddler behavior is in any way indicative of her adulthood, she's shaping up to be a good mother.

After Noumena's exhausted all her interest in the toys, I prompt her to follow me to where there's sports gears and the beanie babies. She picks up the beanie babies and I name each animal they're modeled after getting her to repeat after me. There is an end cap of pet beds nearby that catches her interest, so we go over there and I have her crawl into them like a fort.

I finally decide it's time to go, but a friend of mine was discussing walnuts with me earlier and so I developed a craving. We go to the section housing the snack foods, but unfortunately there are no walnuts. The pistachios are on sale and Noumena loves those, so I go ahead and pick those up and then allow Noumena to pick out a cliff bar she'd like to eat before taking our items to the cash register to pay. She picks the Chocolate brownie one. A solid choice. She taps my card on the reader to pay and we leave snacks in hand. I break off pieces of the cliff bar to feed her on our journey home.

* Hanging Out At Home

Once home, Noumena hasn't finished the cliff bar so I set it at her table to finish and pour a few pistachios into one of her small bowls. There's soymilk still left on the table from dinner, so she drinks that while snacking.

Of course, Noumena wants to read her /Goodnight Little Noumena/ book again, but this time she's very attentive to detail. She flips back and forth through the pages pointing to all of the different characters and animals on each page. When I ask her to point out a specific animal or object, she does before flipping to a different page. I tire of reading the same book to her over and over, so I tell her to get a different book, but she's content to wander after reading so I go and check my computer. While I'm checking, I hear the pitter patter of her toddler shoes against the floor and a subtle voice saying "more." She's brought me her cup of soymilk insisting on having more.

* Bath & Bed Time

Just before bath time comes, I get Noumena to feed the pets. Normally she's so good about doing it, but tonight she spills Chalmers' food all over the floor. Setting the cup of food down while I sweep the pellets has proven to be a futile endeavor, as each time I set it down with the food in it, Noumena dumps it out again. I have to remove it from her reach to finish. I do eventually get all the food back in the cup however and allow her to bring it to Chalmers' dish. However, once we get there, she misses the bowl entirely! Not about to let it happen with Kisa's food, I tell Noumena to put the food on the bathroom floor into Chalmers' dish while I head to the garage to get Kisa's food where I put it into Kisa's bowl myself before assisting Noumena in transferring the remaining dog food from the floor to Chalmers' dish.

As always, we follow our bath time routine. I get her bathed, dressed in pajamas---she chooses the owl pajamas---brush her teeth and tuck her in while our bed time playlist plays. I lay next to her crib grasping he hand through the bars and she falls asleep quickly.

Just like in your book, Goodnight Little Noumena!

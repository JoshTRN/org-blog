[[file:sleeping.jpg]]

Childproofing has become a deeper concern as Noumena grows and becomes more curious and exploratory. Thinking about it prompts reflection on when it was less of a concern. Cabinets she may or may not get into remind me of her first attempts at such ventures. I'm reminded of when she just began walking and I had to bring her into the restroom with me to monitor her while I took care of my business.

These reflections spiral into memories of what Noumena was like then and how fast she's grown. Although I rarely have time to go back and reread entries from days past, I'm beginning to think these entries could be just as much for me as  they are for her. Noumena's second birthday is in 3 months and some change yet it feels like mere moments since I first held that beautiful 7 pound newborn. I remember caressing her face mere minutes after she was fresh out of the womb laying under the heating lamps while the doctors and nurses did whatever they needed to do with a newborn. I remember the magnetic spell I was under as she laid there completely unaware of her father's captivation at her beauty and innocence save for the gentle caress of my fingertips across her perfect cheeks.

Witnessing Noumena's growth is nothing short of a miracle. Her competence is staggering. Before long, fully fleshed out ideas will begin to pour forth from her wonderful imagination and I'll be floored once again at how we've gotten this far.

Although my attention is drawn to the memories, more are sure to come and leave their mark perhaps burying some of the others. Not only do I never want Noumena to have to forget a day she doesn't want to, I never want to forget a moment with her. Obviously, this effort is futile. Even in the span of the day, little details get missed and go unrecorded here. Even if I could record every moment in perfect detail, it would take just as much time to read or playback video as to have new experiences. No matter which way you slice it, something will get lost whatever attempts to mitigate it notwithstanding.

People believe in heaven because nothing short of eternity is long enough...

* Good Morning, Noumena!

Shocked again at Noumena's capacity to sleep, I wake up before she does at 8:30am. As usual I prepare Noumena's breakfast and head in to wake her up. She's still sleeping when I enter the room. Normally my entry is enough, despite however quiet, to startle her awake. Not this time, however. I walk up to her crib and begin gently caressing her hair to wake her up. It's funny thinking back at how she used to be when waking up. She was always excited the moment she opened her eyes, but now waking up has turned into a disturbance. "Let me sleep" is written all over her face as she rolls over to look up at me. Of course, she's not at a stage yet that were I to allow her to go back to sleep, she would. Still, you can tell she's not necessarily happy about the whole affair.

In short order, after playing with her blankets with Daddy, Noumena has fully awakened and is back to her usual energetic self. Fascinated by the tassel on her wall decoration, she points and insists on touching it. I lift her allowing her to play with it before changing her diaper and taking her out to enjoy breakfast with me.

Usually, Noumena has such a big appetite and it's very rare for her to not finish her morning porridge---sometimes even asking for more. But today is different. I'll never be one of those "finish your plate" style parents, so after gently asking a few times if she's finished and she finally gets up, remembering how yesterday she threw a fit, I let her play for a short time before getting her dressed for school.

*  Daycare Is Closed!

Right as I enter through the doors of the daycare at about 9:30am, they inform me that the daycare will be closed today due to strong weather and the possibility of tornadoes, so just as soon as we arrive, we have to leave. That's fine with me, however. I'm happy to spend the day with Noumena.

I took Noumena back home and we listened to music the entire way keeping her content. When we get home, since it's dreary outside, we spend most of the day in doors. The morning is filled with lots of reading and lots of playing with her flash cards. I did get a little work done with Noumena there with me. She joined me in a brief work call, but after that was done, I realized that since Noumena's been so clingy lately, I'm not going to be able to sustain a consistent work cadence, so I take the rest of the day off to attend to her.

After a while, Noumena begins to get fussy. It could be that she's bored or that she's tired. Usually, during the weekdays, she goes down for a nap at about 12pm at daycare. Thinking that's it, at about 12:30pm I lay her down for a nap, and she falls asleep almost immediately.

* Nap & Lunch Time

Noumena only naps for about and hour and a half and I take this time to clean up from breakfast and get her lunch ready. I made beans and rice and just as she's waking up, the beans are finishing cooking. Since she ate so little at breakfast, I worry about her getting enough to eat, so I set her down and let her much on rice that was already cooked while waiting for the beans to cool. She eats all her beans even asking for seconds, but barely touches the rice which is odd, because the rice is usually her favorite part of any meal.

We engage in Noumena's favorite activity, reading, before she herself picks up her jacket and is demanding to go outside. Who am I to refuse??? I don't want to be cooped up here either!!

* Walking To Park

[[file:at-bridge.jpg]]

We take a different route than usual to the park across a bridge Noumena's sure to be interested in. I set her down and she wanders back and forth for a solid 20 minutes.

When she's finally had her fill of walking about, we continue our trip to the park investigating---paths we'd never taken before---Noumena naming and saying 'bye' to various inanimate objects on the way. Chiefly, for some reason, fire hydrants are the objects she's most likely to say 'bye' to.

* Tidewater Acres Park

There's a fire hydrant just outside the park fence, so as we arrive, I set Noumena down to investigate. The manhole cover there has also peaked her curiosity, so before proceeding into the park, she continually bounces upon it.

Our primary activity at the park is swinging. Noumena loves kicking daddy as swings to and fro especially because I make a huge dramatic scene of it every time causing her to laugh the most beautiful laugh in all the world. We move onto to the playground equipment, but it's short lived as it begins to rain so we walk back home.

* Dinner

Arriving home, I'm not quite sure what we're going to do. Noumena fusses a lot today, so despite the fact that it's only been a few hours, since she slept so little, I thought she might need another nap. She lays in her crib a while and eventually it becomes clear to me that she's not ready to nap. Still needing to make dinner, I set her down in front of the TV so that I can cook. I made us spaghetti with mock Italian sausage.

Noumena doesn't want to sit down by herself strangely enough. Instead, she tries to pick from my bowl. I'm happy to sit with her on my lap as she eats despite the mess she makes getting it all over my clothes. Thankfully, neither of us is wearing white.

Again as the night moves on, she begins to get antsy and goes to grab her jacket again. I guess we're going to get wet.

* Walking To CVS

* Back At Home

One benefit to Noumena being in a poor mood is that she definitely wants more affection. She wants to watch more TV, but I don't allow it. Instead I get her distracted with some of her toys and we play with them until somehow I got her interested in the clothes in her room.

[[file:wearing-daddys-glasses-3.jpg]]

* Playing In Crib

Noumena played with her clothes in her room for a long time tonight giving me some time to clean up. Earlier, I'd set her blankets up like a fort draped over the rails of her crib, but she was disinterested then. She becomes interested and we proceed to play in the crib for a long time. Instead of crawling under the blankets, like I'd envisioned, she tries to climb on top of them with obviously no success. Nevertheless, we have lots of fun playing.

Just before bath, I decide to cave and watch a few music videos before getting Noumena ready for bath.

* Bath & Bed Time

Noumena, disinclined to be away from Daddy, follows our bath time routine as closely as she can without distancing herself too much. She throws her laundry in the laundry basket, but doesn't want to throw her diaper away, instead she asks Daddy to carry her to the garbage bin to throw it away. Of course, I do and then set her in the bath.

After bathing, I'd stupidly forgotten to do laundry today although it had occurred to me several times, so we have to resort to normal clothes for pajamas. I learned my lesson yesterday, so I let her play with the tassel on her wall before laying her on her changing table to give her a fresh diaper and dress her in her pajamas.

When I lay her down in her crib, I tuck her in and turn on our playlist. A bit different from usual though, as /Isn't She Lovely/ plays, I leave the light on and stand over her crib caressing her face as she stares back into my eyes. Tears swell to the surface of my eyelids as I adore her laying there peacefully just looking back at Daddy. When /Stand By Me/ comes on, I turn off the lights and hold her hand for the remainder of our playlist as she drifts off to dream land. Even after she's fallen asleep, I remain next to her appreciating the opportunity I have to love her so.

Goodnight, sweet Noumena! I'm glad I got to spend the day with you despite all the challenges we faced from remaining indoors so much! I love you more than you will ever know, baby. Sweet dreams!

* Good Morning, Noumena!

I got to bed an hour early last night finally hoping to get some relief from the exhaustion I've been feeling lately. But you know what that means---I woke up an hour early and could /not/ fall back asleep to save my life. I awoke at 8am and thankfully Noumena, gracious enough to allow me to try to sleep, is silent. I tried to go back to sleep to no avail. Perhaps I drifted in and out of consciousness for the next hour, but ultimately, feeling quite lethargic, forced myself out of bed at 9am. I let Chalmers outside and started warming Noumena's porridge, but while I do so, the groans from Noumena's room begin to reach my ears. Again, I warmed our breakfast in the same bowl only to transfer it to Noumena's bowl once it reached the acceptable temperature. After withdrawn from the microwave, while the food is being mixed, the groans become louder and more anxious. "Daddy's coming, baby" I shout to let Noumena know that I hear her and will be there shortly. The groans intensify...

Hurriedly, I set the table, pour her soy milk and rush down the hall to greet her good morning. I remember that Noumena used to be so excited when I came into her bedroom in the morning. She's typically less so now and I haven't quite put my finger on why. Her not-quite-satisfied face is what I'm usually greeted by these mornings. I can't say I'm complaining, this expression is just as cute as all the others she makes. Still, I'd rather a smile if only for her sake. We play with her blankets for a short while to cheer her up when she signifies to me that she's once again in need of a diaper change. I brace myself for the mess I'm about to experience, but unlike yesterday, none of the feces has breached the edges of her diaper save a small amount near her leg and it's certainly not nearly as much as yesterday. Perhaps that explains the dissatisfied face and the groans. She allows me to change her without much of a fuss and once she in a fresh diaper, I take her trouserless---but not topless---to the dining room to eat breakfast together.

I allow her to take her time eating, but once finished I rushed to get her dressed so we can head out and I'm not late for work. I offer her a choice between her pink top and black bottoms and her white sweat suit. She chooses the latter, so I dress her on my bed, put her jacket on and we head out the door. I set her on the ground and she begins walking to the car as I lock the door to the house. We walk together to the car, I strap her in and we make our way to daycare listening to music along the way.

* Daycare

I was having a lot of difficulty with the video feed at Noumena's daycare today. I'm not sure exactly why, but I did get it working eventually for a brief period of time. For the time I was streaming, I did see something of note. And nap time, the daycare worker sat between Noumena and another child rubbing their backs to help them fall asleep. It was very heartwarming and I could tell that she was being treated well.

When I go to pick her up, since it's Friday and the classes have been reasonably small lately presumably due to the holiday season and parents having time off, all the remaining children were coalesced in the same classroom. I grab her jacket from her classroom, and come back to the classroom she's in without her noticing me as she's sitting with one other child on one of the workers' lap. Another child runs up to hug me just as Noumena notices me. Frantically, she begins shaking in the worker's lap to come running to me. Without saying it, it's clear she's thinking "that's /my/ Daddy!!!" Before the other little girl falls into my embrace Noumena bolts beside her overtaking her and collapsing into Daddy's arms with hers outstretched.

We walk to the car and only stop for the briefest of moments to gaze at the sky and point to the brightest of stars that are just beginning to fill it before I strap her in for the drive home.

* Arriving Home

[[file:crawling-under-christmas-tree-2.jpg]]

When we arrive home and I get Noumena out of her car seat, I immediately set her down on the ground where she takes me by the hand guiding me into the house. Approaching the front door, as we're standing on the porch, she seemingly can't wait to get inside. Stepping onto the door sill---the narrowness of it preventing her from being able to fully stand upon it---as I attempt to unlock the door with one hand, she dangles by one of her hands clasping the other of mine until I finally get it open. Noumena rushes in to greet Chalmers. Immediately, she heads to her favorite book /Goodnight Little Noumena/. I read it to her a couple times and along the way she names all the animals in the book as well as the house and the moon.

Dinner still needs to be made, so in an effort to get her to play independently, I try to get her focused on her flash cards. She's engrossed, but only on the proviso that Daddy's there to enjoy it with her. Eventually, I get her distracted with her Montessori box and slink away to cook us dinner.

* Nighttime Walk

[[file:crazy-eyes.jpg]]

I take a bit of a different route tonight. Along our way, Noumena is trying every multiple syllable word I throw at her. It was just 2 days ago I told her mother that the only 2 syllable word she says consistently is driveway. Her progress seems exponential. She must have tried to say at least 10 2 syllable words!

* Bath & Bed Time

One notable thing about her bath tonight is that although she's always played with her toys, tonight was the first night I think I've seen her take entire bunches of them and swoosh them back and forth all at once.

* Good Morning, Noumena

I stayed up way to late last night, but I was somehow able to drag myself from bed at  8:45am after hitting the snooze a few times on my alarm.  I don't hear any noises undulating from Noumena's room, but as I'm warming her porridge, soft waves of toddler speak begin to reach the kitchen and I know she's awakened. As always, I set her up with a choice of spoon, a bowl of porridge and a glass of soymilk before walking down the hall to greet her good morning.

I can tell Noumena is in a good moon as I step into her room and see her sitting up in the far side of her crib legs engulfed in her many blankets. I'm not sure if I learned this, /per se/, or if it's always simply been instinctual, but I always give Noumena time to make the decision to leave her crib rather than just yanking her out of bed. I think perhaps the reason she was so upset a yesterday when I changed her diaper in the morning was for one reason or another this paternal instinct of mine malfunctioned and right away I removed her from bed to change her diaper.

Usually, the prospect of food is enough to motivate her to demand release from her crib, and today was no different. She points at the canvas pictures of owls hung on her wall as I lift her to carry her out to the dining room, so we make a short pit stop to greet them good morning before I set her down to eat. Her porridge, perhaps a little too hot, strikes he as she tries eating and it's become a new habit of hers to hold her spoon up in request for Daddy to blow on it to cool it down. Sometimes, however, she raises the spoon too vertically causing the food to fall from it. The first bite of today's meal drifts off her spoon as she petitions Daddy to cool it for her. What little is left on the spoon, I cool, but the remainder which has fallen onto the plastic has cooled enough upon contact, so after consuming the first bite, Noumena places the spoon back into the bowl and grasps at what's fallen with her hands eating it that way.  I didn't make myself any porridge this morning, but I did brew a cup of coffee so I sit across from her at her table and drink it while she eats periodically stopping to blow on the occasional spoonful of porridge.

Upon finishing up, I carry her to my bedroom where in keeping with tradition I allow her to choose her top between 2 long sleeve options. She selects the pink blouse, and I choose pants that I think go with it before taking her to her room to get dressed. I take her out to the living room to put on her jacket and shoes which we'd left out there and it's time to go. Forgetting my wallet and keys, I leave her alone in the living room for the briefest of moments, and once I return she's already gotten out her /Goodnight Little Noumena/ book and has started reading it herself on the floor. I allow her to continue doing this for a few minutes before scooping her into my arms and heading out the door.

* Heading Home From Daycare

I travel around the corner to the toddler classroom after entering the daycare and when Noumena sees me, she screeches and starts running at me, but once she realizes I'm coming for her, she promptly turns around and starts running away forcing me to run after her to catch her. I pick up her jacket, walk out of the toddler classroom and set her down to put it on, but instead of immediately going to put on her jacket, she starts showing me the various toys and things in her classroom. Eventually she capitulates allowing me to slip her arms through the sleeves of her jacket and we take our leave after I have a brief conversation with the teacher about bringing Noumena some spare tops.

I was on the phone with a friend when we were leaving, but concluded the conversation on our drive home. All the while that the conversation was going, however, Noumena was talking to herself in the back seat. I know I've seen and heard a lot of rambling, but today it seems different. It seems extremely intentional and like she's really trying to have a conversation. The progress seems so striking---leaps and bounds as though all of a sudden she's trying to say sentences punctuated by brief periods of silence to differentiate one sentence from the next. So I decide to participate getting her to repeat after me any word that comes to mind making for an extremely pleasant ride home.

* Dinner

I had already warmed dinner before I left and it was waiting on the stove for us, but once we got home Noumena, excited to see Chalmers, ran up to him to give him a kiss. He went wild upon her arrival too running back and forth so I let him outside to burn off some steam. Noumena then climbs onto the couch holding her owl backpack containing her flash cards. She's frustrated because it's zipped up, so I instruct her on how to open it and give her a few attempts at unzipping before ultimately helping her open it the rest of the way. We play with her flash cards until her mother arrives.

Noumena, growing hungry, goes to sit down at the table and her mother says that she's hungry. I had intended to wait on feeding her since her mother wanted to make "pigs in a blanket" in the oven with her, but her mom says that she can have both the dinner I made as well as the hot dogs they were going to make and eat together, so I prepare her rice and tofu green curry restaurant style before presenting it to her to sit down to eat. As she's eating, the hotdogs finish cooking and her mother sits across from Noumena at her table and eats with her.

* Nighttime Walk

I had some work to finish up, so I let Noumena and her mother play together as I went in my office to continue working. Mommy reads to Noumena and plays with flash cards while I work.

I exit my office at around 7pm and knowing that Noumena isn't going to need to exhaust her grandiose amounts of energy, so I take her outside to have a walk. We get halfway down the street and Noumena's asking to be held, so I carry her in my arms all the way to the church. Along the way, she reminds me again of her amazing progress in toddler gibberish sentence crafting so I have to film it.

Once we have reach a grass patch engulfed by the parking lot, she wants to be let down and she runs all the way through the grass as far as she can before reaching the asphalt. I get her to follow me jumping on various curbs and trying to get her to follow my lead. She eventually makes her way to the bench where she enjoys jumping off into Daddy's arms. This is great! She climbs onto the bench several times in order to jump off. Her exhausting herself like this is just what the doctor ordered. After doing this maybe 10 times she finally decides to move on to other curiosities discovering my shadow stretched across the wall which peaks her interest and begins a chase.

It's very cold for Florida tonight, so we don't play as long as we usually do, but I feel she's sufficiently worn out enough to warrant the trip back home. As usual, we name the objects along our route all the way home.

* Back At Home

As we pass through the entryway to the house, I set Noumena down to go run up to Mommy to show her how cold her hands are. Mommy is concerned and holds Noumena's hands against her body in an effort to draw heat back to her extremities. Mommy was watching a viking show and I still had work to do, so I let the watch and go back to my office to finish up.

While working, Noumena gets the idea to start pushing her chair around pushing it all the way down the hall where Daddy is working before turning around and pushing it all the way back into the kitchen and finally the dining room.

While working, Mommy and Noumena made me vegan pudding and Mommy had Noumena carry it to me. I sit down at my piano bench to eat it sharing it with Noumena periodically. When I've scraped the last bits of pudding from the glass in which it was brought to me, I give it to Noumena and tell her to bring it back to Mommy. She of course obliges leaving me to complete my work. When it's 5 til 8:30pm, I leave to get Noumena ready to take a bath.

* Bath & Bed Time

Noumena and I follow our typical routine traveling to the bathroom where I allow her to rotate the knob turning on the faucet and throwing the wash clothes I use to bathe her into the tub. I always let her test the water with her hands making sure it's nice and warm before we go to my bedroom where I can remove her clothes and have her transfer them to my laundry basket. When Noumena enters the tub, Mommy takes her leave kissing wet baby Noumena on the forehead and saying goodbye before she goes. After washing Noumena down, draining the water and putting her bath toys back in the net that holds them, she flails around in the tub a bit before finally standing allowing Daddy to extract her from the tub.

I dress her in her starry pajamas and brush her hair and teeth before bringing her into her room for bed time. As with yesterday, I set her down in the crib before turning the lights off. I can't figure out exactly why, but it's almost as if Noumena loves bed time. I prep one of her blankets to act as a pillow while she tumbles into the remaining blankets in her crib before laying her head on the pillow-blanket. Her magical smile looks up at me as I drape a second blanket across her outstretched body. I turn the lights off, start our bed time playlist and reach my hand through the bars of her crib to gently grasp hers laying down so she falls asleep next to Daddy. Thinking she was full of energy, I anticipated being in there quite a while, but halfway through /Just The Two Of Us/ I can tell Noumena is fast asleep. Nevertheless, I lay beside her holding her hand until the playlist is over before exiting her bedroom.

I can tell you're going to have a wonderful sleep, Noumena. I wish you only the sweetest of dreams and am excited to see you in the morning.

Goodnight, my lovely, precious gift!

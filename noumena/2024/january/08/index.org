* Good Morning, Noumena!

Having slept well last night, I actually get out bed at a decent time this morning. At 8:30am, I get up and, warm Noumena's porridge. She's still sleeping and as I try to enter her room, trying to sneak up on her, my attempts are thwarted and she wakes up to see me. Noumena spends very little time following her typical roll around the crib routine instead opting to get out immediately. Thankfully, No dirty diaper today, so I can just take her right to the table to start eating.

It's about 9am when it's finally time to leave after breakfast and Noumena wants to play  with her flash cards instead. Disallowing her because we have to go, I feel guilty about it while she throws a big tantrum. Honestly,  if it were up to me, I'd have just let her play. Unfortunately, circumstance compels me to force her to get ready for the day. I take her into my bedroom to pick her outfit and, in a somewhat disgruntled way, Noumena begrudgingly picks her pink outfit over her blue and I get her dressed. She's calmed by the time it's time to put on her shoes, so I slip her feet into her black shoes and we head out the door. We listen to music the entire car ride to daycare and she absolutely loves it.

* Early Arrival From Daycare

Over the weekend, Noumena had developed a bit of a runny nose and she had been more plagued by separation anxiety than usual. Her mother noticed it when I left Sunday evening for a short while and I noticed it when her mother left after reading her a story. Watching her on the daycare cameras today, I couldn't stop thinking about how I wish she didn't have to go, so I called her mom and asked her if she could pick Noumena up from daycare a little early to spend more time with us.

When Noumena gets home, Mommy tells her to go find Daddy. Hearing this, I begin walking down the hall. When Noumena sees me, she runs to me arms outstretched. There isn't a greater joy in this world. She falls into my embrace and stays there, hugging me for at least 5 seconds. The fact that she wanted the prolonged embrace made it all the more satisfying. I could have lived the rest of my life and perished in her arms a happy man. She turns around, wanting to go back over to Mommy, but not wanting to leave Daddy, so she demands to be carried. I of course capitulate carrying her over to where her mother is sitting and we sit and read a book that Mommy had gotten from the library with Noumena just before they came home

We play with all the typical toys, Noumena's cards and read several books. Noumena's newest favorite book has become /If You Give A Mouse A Cookie/ which I was reminded I bought from Barnes & Noble after having seen it there and remembering I'd read that book a lot when I was a child. Without a doubt, Noumena turned the pages of that book at least 10 times in a single sitting. When I say it's her favorite book now, I mean it's literally her favorite book. She absolutely loves it. In some way I feel it connects me to her more deeply knowing that a book so loved by me as a child is in turn also loved by her. I no longer have my copy (obviously) but I never want her to lose hers, or any other book she loves for that matter. I hope the books she loves allow her to feel the same joy and connection I feel with her with her children some day.

I wasn't sure what to do for dinner, so as the night continues, I ask Mommy if she'd like to join Noumena and me for dinner at Olive Garden. Initially, she agrees, but then informs me that she'd like to go to Red Robin. Having vegan options, I agree to go there. I put Noumena's shoes back on, make sure she has her jacket in the car and we head to the restaurant. We listen to music the entire way and it keeps Noumena entertained without the need for additional stimulation, which excites me without end.

* Dinner

Mommy and I walk Noumena into Red Robin each of her hands in one of ours the way Noumena likes. Just as we enter, I look to the right noticing there are balloons tied to small plastic rods just to the right. I pick one up and hand it to Noumena to play with as Mommy discusses the seating arrangements with the host. Noumena, balloon in hand, noticing a light surrounded by a mesh-patterned bulbous round lamp shade points and says light. I tell her we can touch it with the balloon, so I hold her up and she bounces the balloon off the lamp shade before we find our seat.

I notice the dessert menu out of the corner of my eye and decide to investigate whether there's anything vegan on it. I don't notice anything, vegan on it, but the dessert idea has crawled its way into my mind and now, unable to resist, I decide I'll find some vegan dessert somewhere close-by.

* Dessert

After a quick google search, I found a place close by that has vegan ice cream called The Yard Milkshake Bar, so we head there so I can get my fix. We walk through, order the vanilla vegan ice cream on a sugar cone and wander through the milkshake bar before they make it for me. Photos and art of cows adorn the walls along with other pieces creating a very rustic /Ã¦/sthetic.

I set Noumena down on the counter-top and we enjoy our ice cream together.

Noumena's content on the ride home for the most part, but 5 minutes before our arrival begins to fuss. The whines are immediately assuaged the moment I turn music on for Noumena and we enjoy the rest of the car ride home.

* Nighttime Walk

When we get home, the first thing Noumena wants to do is read her books. Once again, we read /If You Give A Mouse A Cookie/ another dozen or so times before I notice how late it's getting and how much Noumena has. Knowing she has to expend all her pent up energy, I take her outside. Attempting to get her to walk some of it off, I set her down to walk alongside me. She refuses, however, demanding to be carried---only finally deciding to get around running once we get to the church.

* Bath & Bed Time

It's bath time immediately as we get home. I let her draw the bath as usual before stripping her down to put her clothes in the laundry basket. Somewhat inconsistent with our routine, Noumena while throwing away her diaper, sees a blanket on my floor and gets distracted. I redirect her to throw away the diaper, but for some reason or another upsets her, so I take her in my arms to finish the task and when I do she's content once again. I set her in the bath and bathe her rather quickly.

Following the theme of slight discordance with our routine, I don't allow her to choose her pajamas... Not because I didn't want to, but I've run out of clean pajamas! Instead, she has a pair of pants to seem just like her pajamas, so I put her in those and the top to her normal owl pajamas were clean so I put her in a mismatched bed time outfit. There's something about the owl banner wall art that really upsets her when I don't let her play with the tassel on it. While changing her diaper, she's screaming upset by it. I'm not sure why, but tomorrow before I put her to bed, I'm going to let her play with it for a few seconds if she wants before getting her dressed.

I lay Noumena down, tuck her in and begin our bed time playlist holding her hand as she falls asleep.

Good night, sweet Noumena! I had so much fun with you today and am glad we got to enjoy ice cream together for a wonderful treat after dinner! I'm looking forward to tomorrow with you. Kisses, baby. Sleep well!

* Bed Time

Writing has been very difficult for me these past few months. I've also had a hard time just keeping up with adding the photos and videos to the journal entries. I will catch up to the photos and videos and have been making progress getting caught back up to tonight, but no matter what something happened at bed time tonight I never want to forget.

Noumena and I followed our usual bed time routine tonight, which for the past few months has consisted of getting her bathed, putting on her pajamas, brushing her teeth and watching TV for 20-25 minutes until 8:40pm which is her bed time. Since she's grown, falling asleep takes much longer than it used to. Some nights, particularly the bad nights when she's frustrated and angry about going to bed, it can take up to an hour for her to finally fall asleep. Tonight, however, was different.

An episode of the [[https://youtu.be/VV9_ClhuHNo][Twins and Toys]] show that we've found turns out to be her favorite show was just coming to an end just as 8:40pm rolled around. At 8:39pm I told her it was her bed time and started getting ready to shut off the TV to take her into her room. It used to be that I would let her white noise machine come on naturally at 9pm, but I find it's easier to get her to go to sleep with it on, so I turn it on early every night. Tonight, I hadn't done that before bed time and noticing that there was only a few seconds left of her show, I decided to go into her room, turn it on and close the blinds in her room. The summer months have made it so it's not fully dark in her room even so late at night, so I've been closing them for her.

When I finish, I head back into the room and Noumena's show has finished and she had crawled off of my bed and was ready to go to her room. I informed her that she left her favorite blanky on the bed, and in going back to retrieve it, she grabbed the remote to shut off the TV. I helped her shut it off and was so proud of her for getting ready for bed. Following Noumena into her room while she carried her blanky to her bed telling her how proud I was of her and what a good girl she was for not fighting bed time at all.

What followed I can only describe as a dream come true. Noumena crawled into bed and Daddy laid with her as usual. At first I smothered her with kisses on her cheeks, mouth, forehead and nose which was followed by expressions of glee only a child is capable of. We talked about so much tonight, and although I can't remember the variety of topics of interest to my 2 year old daughter, there were a few things that stood out. For one, she explained that the reason that Mommy wasn't home when we got back from the park and wasn't there to say goodnight to Noumena is that Mommy was in daycare.

Noumena hasn't yet realized that not every object in the world is imbued with agency and so has taken to given directive to inanimate objects. Tonight, her blanket was told to go to sleep and to stop whatever it was doing several times. It was also described as sleepy. A word she's fixated on has been "yucky." Several times she referred to herself as a yucky baby, and with every "yucky" came a screech of glee on the final syllable.

Laying there, completely enthralled with the inner workings of this little girl, I'd never felt such joy. Seeing Noumena's face in the dim light of her white noise machine, I've never been so in love in my life. Up to the point where she'd fallen asleep, laughter and smiles abounded. There wasn't a twinge of dissatisfaction the entire time and ever second of it only deepened my infatuation with this little girl. Every hardship of my life was totally worth it for just a glimmer of these small moments.

Eventually, the conversation slowed to a halt as I began to run my fingers through her hair, which is something until now hasn't enticed Noumena much. When I stopped, she asked me to continue and so I did until she fell asleep while I was running my fingers through her hair.

Noumena, you are my entire world.

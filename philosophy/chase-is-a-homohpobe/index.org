I've been unreasonably interested in this clip ever since I discovered it. Mostly because Chase as supremely confident as you'd expect any good fuckboi to be while saying something completely unintelligible. You might think I'm being unfair, but by the time this video is over, I'm going to convince you that what this guy is saying like someone saying 2+2=5 with unparalleled confidence and having a great time doing it.


The question that was asked of Chase was, "would you rather have sex with the hottest transwoman in the world or the oldest [cis]woman in the world?" And he chooses the oldest woman. Let's just assume it's not because he has a fetish for old people. He may well have such a fetish and that may be what explains his answer, but this interpretation doesn't preclude the possibility that the hottest transwoman is just as old as the oldest ciswoman in this hypothetical. No. The spirit of the question is that "old" is an agist proxy for unattractive. Let me then pose the reformulated, more accurate question, "would you rather have sex with the most attractive transwoman or the least attractive ciswoman?"

Chase's answer in essence is that the least attractive ciswoman will always be more attractive than the most attractive transwoman. Why is this his answer? He tells us. It's because Chase is not gay. It's really important to Chase that you the viewer and as many others as possible to know that he's definitely super not gay. Later, one woman pipes in saying "It's his sexuality." We'll come back to this momentarily.

When he says this the woman sitting across from him becomes visibly upset and says she wants to rip him a new one. He responds by asking her if she's upset that he's transphobic and she of course gives the correct answer in saying that he is, in fact, transphobic and emphasizing the insanity of his view by saying "what the fuck do you mean?" This question, what does Chase mean, is a good question and a large part of why I said what he's saying is unintelligible. The transphobia is not the most interesting part of Chase's attitude, however, it's his homophobia.

You see, Chase is deeply, deeply afraid of being gay. I know this because when it comes to the topic of homosexuality, which is a topic hitherto only mentioned by him, a homophobic blackhole opens in his head, he starts to spasm, and all critical thinking ability flies out the window, what little of it may have existed prior. To demonstrate this, let's take look at what he says:

"I'd be gay if I had sex with a biological man."

Here Chase conflates "being gay" with having homosexual activity, demonstrating that he has worse reasoning capability than that of a child. It's embarrassing that I am going to explain things so obvious, but just in case it isn't clear, the commonly understood definition of being gay is being solely or at least primarily attracted to the same sex. Homosexual activity just engaging in some sort of sexual activity with a member of the same sex. An obvious consequence to Chase's idiotic view is that every person who's ever been raped by another person of the same sex is therefore gay.
